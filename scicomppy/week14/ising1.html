<h1>Ising model - theory</h1>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The Ising model is a mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical 
mechanics. The model consists of discrete variables that represent magnetic 
dipole moments of atomic "spins" that can be in one of two states (+1 or âˆ’1).
The spins are arranged in a periodical lattice, allowing each spin 
to interact with its neighbors.
Neighboring spins that agree have a lower energy than those that disagree; 
the system tends to the lowest energy but heat disturbs this tendency, 
thus creating the possibility of different structural phases. 
The model allows the identification of phase transitions, 
as a simplified model of reality. 
The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is one of the simplest 
statistical models to show a phase transition.

The energy of a spin configuration S = {S_i} is given by the Hamiltonian function

H(S) = -J \sum_ij S_i S_j,

where the sum is over pairs of adjacent spins (nearest neighbors),
S_i is a spin configuration at a site i,
J is an interaction [J has dimensions of energy],
\beta = 1 / (k_B T) [k_B T has dimensions of energy],
k_B is the Boltzmann constant.

If J &gt; 0 then the interaction is called 'ferromagnetic'.
If J &lt; 0 then the interaction is called 'antiferromagnetic'.
If J = 0 then the spins are 'noninteracting'.

Z(\beta) = \sum_S exp(-\beta H(S)) is the partition function.

The configuration probability is given by the Boltzmann distribution

P_{\beta}(S) = exp(-\beta H(S)) / Z(\beta).

The expectation (mean) value of a function F of the spins is

&lt;F&gt;_{\beta} = \sum_{S} F(S) P_{\beta}(S).

The mean energy is &lt;H&gt;_{\beta}.

Magnetization M(S) = \sum_i S_i.

The mean magnetization is &lt;M&gt;_{\beta}.

Problem: for a 10x10 lattice there is 2^100 ~ 10^30 possible configurations.
We are not able to calculate Z(\beta), P_{\beta}(S), and mean values.

This motivates the reason for the Ising model to be simulated using MC methods.

<h3>2D ISING MODEL</h3>

<p>In the ferromagnetic case there is a phase transition.

<p>The transition temperature is T_c = 2.2692 [1944 Onsager].

<h3>3D ISING MODEL</h3>

<p>In the ferromagnetic case there is a continuous phase transition.

<p>The transition temperature is T_c = 4.5116 (the critical point).
