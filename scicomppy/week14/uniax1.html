<h3>LIQUID CRYSTALS</h3>

<p>Liquid crystals (LC) are a state of matter which has properties between 
those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. 
For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules 
may be oriented in a crystal-like way.
LC molecules are similar to rods or discs.
There are many different types of liquid-crystal phases:
<br>nematic LC (orientational order only), 
<br>smectic LC (2D crystals), 
<br>columnar phases (1D crystals), etc.

<p>LC systems are studied in 'soft matter physics', 
a subfield of 'condensed matter physics'.

<h3>LEBWOHL-LASHER MODEL</h3>

<p>http://www.sklogwiki.org/SklogWiki/index.php/Lebwohl-Lasher_model

<p>The Lebwohl-Lasher model is a lattice version of the Maier-Saupe 
mean field model of a nematic liquid crystal.
A cubic lattice is occupied by uniaxial nematogenic particles 
with the pair potential H_ij.

<hr><pre>
H_ij = -\epsilon P_2(\cos \theta_ij),

where \epsilon &gt; 0, 
\theta_ij is the angle between the axes of nearest neighbour particles i and j, 
and P_2(x) = (3x^2-1)/2 is a second order Legendre polynomial.

For parallel particles H_ij = -\epsilon P_2(1) = -\epsilon.

Note that vectors \vec{n} and -\vec{n} describe the same particle orientation.
