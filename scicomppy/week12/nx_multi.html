<h1>NetworkX - multigraphs</h1>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>A 'multigraph' is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges
(parallel edges), that is, edges that have the same end nodes.
A 'loop' is an edge that connects a vertex to itself.

import networkx as nx

G = nx.MultiGraph()   # an undirected multigraph
H = nx.MultiDiGraph()   # a directed multigraph
