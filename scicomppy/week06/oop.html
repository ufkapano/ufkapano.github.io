<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based 
on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data (attributes)
and procedures (methods).
Methods can access and often modify the attributes of the object 
with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self").
Computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that 
interact with one another.

<p>Classes sometimes correspond to things found in the real world. 

<p><strong>Inheritence</strong> in typically used for code reuse.

<p><strong>Encapsulation</strong> is an object-oriented programming 
concept that binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, 
and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. 
Data encapsulation led to the important OOP concept of data hiding.

<p>Objects can contain other objects in their instance variables; 
this is known as object <strong>composition</strong>.

<p><strong>A software design pattern</strong> is a general, 
reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context 
in software design. 
It is a template for how to solve a problem that can be used 
in many different situations.

<p>Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications 
based on kind of problem they solve.
<br>(a) Creational patterns (abstract factory, singleton)
<br>(b) Structural patterns (adapter, decorator)
<br>(c) Behavioural patterns (iterator, visitor)

# A simple example class.

        print("Hello")

# Driver code.
instance = MyClass()
instance.speak()   # Hello
MyClass.speak(instance)   # the same, instance as self
