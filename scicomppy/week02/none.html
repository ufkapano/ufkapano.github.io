<h1>None</h1>

<h3>INTRO</h3>

<p>'None' is a special value representing 'nothing' (null object).

<p>Use cases:
<br>(a) a variable created but not processed yet;
in graph coloring: a node without color.
<br>(b) a way to reset a variable to an empty state.

<hr><pre>
answer = None
# ... some code ...
if answer is None:
    quit = True
elif answer == "quit":
    quit = True
else:
    quit = False
</pre><hr>

<p>'None' is a singleton, there is only one instance of it in a program.
<br>Testing 'answer is None' is better then 'answer == None'
[or 'answer is not None'].

<p>Functions without an explicit 'return' statement return 'None'.
That way, programming with functions is much simplified; 
a function always returns 'something'.
