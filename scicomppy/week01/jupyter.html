<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The name 'Jupyter' referred to 'Julia', 'Python' and 'R', 
the initial languages which were implemented.

<p>'IPython' (Interactive Python) provides a rich architecture 
for interactive computing in Python.

<p>'Project Jupyter' is a spin-off project from IPython.
It consists of the notebook and other language-agnostic parts of IPython.
It supports execution environments in several dozen languages
(Python, Julia, R, C++, Scheme, Ruby).

<p>'Jupyter Notebook' is a web-based interactive computational environment 
for creating Jupyter notebook documents (JSON documents). 
The notebook interface is used for various computational back ends
(Mathematica, MATLAB, Maple, Python, Julia, Scala).
A Jupyter Notebook can be converted to a number of open standard output formats 
(HTML, presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown, Python).

<p>'JupyterLab' is the next-generation web-based user interface 
for Project Jupyter. 

<p>An interactive session in Jupyter consists of a 'frontend' (the console, 
GUI or web interface in which code is entered and results displayed), 
and a 'kernel' (the process responsible for executing your code).
The frontend and kernel communicate using the ZMQ messaging library.

<h3>INSTALLING JUPYTER IN LINUX</h3>

<hr><pre>
Three methods are available:
(1) apt (Debian),
(2) snap package,
(3) conda (Anaconda).
</pre><hr><pre>
# Debian 10 packages: python-notebook (Python 2), python3-notebook (Python 3),
# jupyter-notebook (5.7.8-1), jupyter-core.
# /etc/jupyter/nbconfig - a directory with JSON files
# ~/.jupyter - a directory with user config files
