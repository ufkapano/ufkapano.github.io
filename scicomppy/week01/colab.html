<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Colab is a free Jupyter notebook environment that runs in the browser 
using Google Cloud.

<p>Colab notebooks allow you to combine executable code and rich text 
in a single document, along with images, HTML, LaTeX and more. 

<p>Access to computing resources including GPUs and TPUs.
Code is executed in a virtual machine private to your account.

<p>You can run the session in an interactive Colab Notebook for 12 hours.

<p>One more thing to keep in mind is that the dataset you upload 
in the Colab notebook gets deleted once the session is ended.

<p>Colab notebooks are stored on Google Drive (15 GB of disk space), 
or can be loaded from GitHub.

<p>Colab notebooks can be shared as files from Google Docs.
