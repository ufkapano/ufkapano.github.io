<br>Frequently Asked Questions about using Python on Windows

<h3>WINDOWS 10</h3>

<p>Windows does not include a system supported installation of Python.
To make Python available, the CPython team has compiled Windows installers 
(MSI packages) with every release for many years.

<p>Python 3.9 supports Windows 8.1 and newer.

<p>Multiple versions of Python can be installed on your machine
and these all use the 'python' command.
It is recommended to use the 'python3' command
(or 'python3.8' to select a specific version).

<p>The 'py.exe' launcher will automatically select the most recent 
version of Python you've installed.
You can also use commands like 'py -3.8' to select a particular version, 
or 'py --list' to see which versions can be used.
