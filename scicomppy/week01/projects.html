<h1>Final project proposals</h1>

<ul>

<li>Use NetworkX to create a complete weighted graph K_n 
for n random points in the plane. 
The edge weights are the distances between points.
Find the minimum spanning tree.
Plot the MST using Matplotlib.

<li>Use NetworkX to create a complete weighted graph K_n 
for n random points in the plane. 
The edge weights are the distances between points.
Solve the travelling salesman problem using any heuristic algorithm
(nearest neighbor, sorted edge).
Plot the solution using Matplotlib.

<li>Use NetworkX to create a complete weighted graph K_n 
for n random points in the plane. 
The edge weights are the distances between points.
Use Kruskal's algorithm for cluster analysis.
Plot clusters using Matplotlib.

<li>Use pandas to create a database with books, films or songs.
Required operations: list, insert, remove, search.
The database should be saved to a text file (JSON or CSV).

<li>Create a game tic-tac-toe with a Tkinter GUI or on the console
(user vs computer).
Save game results to a log file.

<li>Create a game Battleship with a Tkinter GUI or on the console
(user vs computer).
Save game results to a log file.

<li>Download data on fluel prices (Orlen), currency rates, etc.
Show time dependence using Matplotlib.

<li>Implement a maze generation algorithm.
Show the result on the console or as an image.

<li>Generate the Mandelbrot set.
