<br>How to run Anaconda side by side with other Pythons

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Anaconda Individual Edition contains conda and Anaconda Navigator, 
as well as Python and hundreds of scientific packages.

<p>Conda works on your command line interface such as Anaconda Prompt 
on Windows and terminal on MacOS and Linux.

<p>Navigator is a desktop graphical user interface that allows you 
to launch applications and easily manage conda packages, environments, 
and channels without using command-line commands.

<h3>SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS</h3>

<p>Operating system: Windows 8 or newer, 64-bit Linux.

<p>System architecture: Windows- 64-bit x86, 32-bit x86; Linux- 64-bit x86.

<p>Minimum 5 GB disk space to download and install.

<p>On Windows, MacOS, and Linux, it is best to install Anaconda 
for the local user, which does not require administrator permissions 
and is the most robust type of installation. 
However, if you need to, you can install Anaconda system wide, 
which does require administrator permissions.

<p>You do not need to uninstall other Python installations or packages 
before installing Anaconda.

<h3>WINDOWS</h3>

<p>https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/

<p>A suggested folder for Anaconda is C:\anaconda\.
<br>The 'default path' in Windows 10 is C:\Users\your_username\Anaconda3\.

<p>We recommend that you do not add Anaconda to the Windows PATH 
because this can interfere with other software.
Instead, open Anaconda with the Start Menu and select Anaconda Prompt, 
or use Anaconda Navigator.

<p>PyCharm can be installed with Anaconda.

<p>The default Anaconda installation option is 'Just Me'.
If you have administrator access, you can choose to install for 'All Users'.
A new group AnacondaUsers should be created.

<p>From the Start menu, click the Anaconda Navigator desktop app.


<h3>LINUX</h3>

<p>https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/

<p>Download the Anaconda installer for Linux (64-Bit, x86).
<br>Install the following extended dependencies for Qt (Debian Linux):
<br>apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libegl1-mesa libxrandr2 libxrandr2 
libxss1 libxcursor1 libxcomposite1 libasound2 libxi6 libxtst6

<p>The 'default path' in Linux is /home/your_username/anaconda3.

<p>Multi-user Anaconda installation on Linux requires sudo access.
A new group should be created for Anaconda users.

<p>Open a terminal window and type 'anaconda-navigator'.

<p>https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/
<br>Uninstalling Anaconda: (a) use simple remove, 
(b) use Anaconda-Clean (conda install anaconda-clean).

<h3>CONDA</h3>

<p>Conda is a completely separate tool to pip, virtualenv and wheel, but 
provides many of their combined features in terms of package management, 
virtual environment management and deployment of binary extensions.
