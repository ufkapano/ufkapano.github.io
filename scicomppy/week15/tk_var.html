<h1>Tkinter - variables</h1>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Some widgets can be connected directly to application variables 
by using special options: 
variable (Radiobutton, Checkbutton, Scale), 
textvariable (Label, Button, Entry), 
onvalue, offvalue, and value (Radiobutton).
This connection works both ways: if the variable changes for any reason, 
the widget it's connected to will be updated to reflect the new value. 
These Tkinter control variables are used like regular Python variables 
to keep certain values. It's not possible to hand over a regular Python 
variable to a widget through a variable or textvariable option.
The only kinds of variables for which this works are variables that are 
subclassed from a class called Variable, defined in the Tkinter module. 

<p>Tkinter variables are useful because they live on after the widgets
they are tied to have been destroyed. It is possible to fetch input
values from them long after the widgets has been dismissed.

<hr><pre>
s = tk.StringVar()   # Holds a string; default value ""; textvariable has to be used
i = tk.IntVar()   # Holds an integer; default value 0
x = tk.DoubleVar()   # Holds a float; default value 0.0
b = tk.BooleanVar()   # Holds a boolean, returns 0 for False and 1 for True
x.set(1.2)   # changing the value of a variable
x.get()   # reading the current value of a variable

# Using Entry with variables.

var = tk.StringVar()
entry = tk.Entry(root, textvariable=var)
var.set("new string")
print(var.get())
