<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>A partial differential equation (PDE) is an equation which imposes 
relations between the various partial derivatives of a multivariable function.
It is usually impossible to write down explicit formulas for solutions 
of partial differential equations.
There is, correspondingly, a vast amount of modern mathematical and scientific 
research on methods to numerically approximate solutions 
of certain partial differential equations using computers. 

<p>There are existence and uniqueness theorems for differential equations
where the domain of the unknown function is regarded as part of the problem.
There are several possible boundary conditions for the unknown function.

<p>The 'Dirichlet boundary condition' specifies the values that a solution 
needs to take along the boundary of the domain.

<p>The Neumann boundary condition specifies the values of the derivative 
applied at the boundary of the domain.

<hr><pre>
An unknown function u(x, y),
u_x, u_y - first partial derivatives,
u_xx, u_xy, u_yy - second partial derivatives.

u_xx + u_yy = 0 is Laplace's equation,

where u = 0 on the boundary (Dirichlet problem).

<h3>NUMERICAL SOLUTIONS</h3>

<p>The three most widely used numerical methods to solve PDEs are:
<br>(1) the finite element method (FEM),
<br>(2) the finite difference method (FDM),
<br>(3) the finite volume method (FVM).
