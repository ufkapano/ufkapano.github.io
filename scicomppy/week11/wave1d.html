<h3>INTRO</h3>

<p>The wave equation is an important second-order linear partial 
differential equation for the description of waves,
such as mechanical waves or light waves. 

<p>The wave equation is the simplest example of a hyperbolic 
differential equation.

Unknown function  u(x,t)
u_tt = c^2 u_xx, x in [0,L], t in [0,T].
c is the constant wave velocity of the medium.

Homogeneous Dirichlet conditions in 1D.
u(x,0) = f(x), x in [0,L], (initial string shape)
u_t(x,0) = 0, x in [0,L], (string starts from rest)
u(0,t) = 0, u(L,t) = 0, t in [0,T]. (fixed ends, no displacement)

Exact solution u(x,t) = f_R(x-ct) + f_L(x+ct),
For t=0: f_R(x) + f_L(x) = f(x), -cf_R' + cf_L' = 0.
Solution: f_R(y) = f_L(y) = f(y)/2,
u(x,t) = ( f(x-ct) + f(x+ct) )/2.
[Boundary conditions may create reflected waves.]

Waves on string, wave1D_u0.py
The initial condition f(x) typically has a triangular shape for a picked guitar string.
A peak is at x_0 in [0,L], f(x) = 
[ x/x_0 for x &lt; x_0,
[ (L-x) / (L-x_0) otherwise.

Discretizing the domain
x = i*dx, i = 0..Nx (Nx+1 points), Nx*dx = L, (mesh in space)
t = j*dt, j = 0..Nt (Nt+1 points), Nt*dt = T, (mesh in time)
We use the notation u(i,j)

Finite difference stencil (or scheme)
u_tt = [u(i,j-1) -2*u(i,j) + u(i,j+1)] / (dt*dt)   # central difference O(dt^2)
u_xx = [u(i-1,j) -2*u(i,j) + u(i+1,j)] / (dx*dx)   # central difference O(dx^2)

r = (c*dt/dx)^2, interior mesh points
Stability criterion: r &lt; 1.
u(i,j-1) -2*u(i,j) + u(i,j+1) = r*[u(i-1,j) -2*u(i,j) + u(i+1,j)]

The stencil for the first time level.
u_t = [u(i,j+1) - u(i,j)] / dt   # forward difference O(dt)
u_t(x,0) = 0, u(i,1) = u(i,0), NOT GOOD

u_t = [u(i,j+1) - u(i,j-1)] / (2*dt)   # central difference O(dt^2)
u_t(x,0) = 0, u(i,1) = u(i,-1), how to get u(i,-1)?
Use the equation
2*u(i,1) -2*u(i,0) = r*[u(i-1,0) -2*u(i,0) + u(i+1,0)],

Generalized problem.
u_tt = c^2 u_xx + s(x,t), x in [0,L], t in [0,T].
c is the constant wave velocity of the medium,
