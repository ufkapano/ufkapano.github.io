<h1>1D heat equation</h1>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation

<h3>INTRO</h3>

<p>The diffusion equation is a parabolic partial differential equation.
In physics, it describes the macroscopic behavior of many micro-particles 
in Brownian motion, resulting from the random movements and collisions 
of the particles.
In mathematics, it is related to Markov processes, such as random walks, 
and applied in many other fields.

<hr><pre>
Unknown function  u(x,t), x in [0,L], t in [0,T],
u_t = D * u_xx, D is the diffusion coefficient.
[u_t is time derivative, u_xx is double spacial derivative.]
If D is constant we get the heat equation.
Initial condition  u(x,0) = f(x).
Boundary condition  u(0,t) = g1(t) and u(L,t) = g2(t).

#          j  u(0,t)=g1(t),   t increasing --&gt;
#  x=0  +--+--+--+--
#       |  |  |  |
# u(x,0)+--+--o--+--
# =f(x) |  |  |  |
#       +--+--o--o--  u(i,j)
#       |  |  |  |
#     i +--+--o--+--
#       |  |  |  |
#  x=L  +--+--+--+--
#          j  u(L,t)=g2(t)

x = i*dx, i = 0..Nx (Nx+1 points), Nx*dx = L,
t = j*dt, j = 0..Nt (Nt+1 points), Nt*dt = T,

u_t = [ u(i,j+1) - u(i,j) ] / dt   # forward difference O(dt)
u_xx = [ u(i-1,j) -2*u(i,j) + u(i+1,j) ] / (dx*dx)   # central difference O(dx^2)

r = D*dt / (dx*dx), formula is stable if r &lt;= 0.5

u(i,j+1) - u(i,j) = r * [ u(i-1,j) -2*u(i,j) + u(i+1,j) ]

Final formula (inside mesh)
for j in range(Nt):
    for i in range(1,Nx):
        u(i,j+1) = r*u(i-1,j) + (1-2*r)*u(i,j) + r*u(i+1,j)

Initial condition, t=0 (j=0)
for i in range(Nx+1):
    u(i,0) = f(i*dx)

Boundary condition, x=0 (i=0) and x=L (i=Nx)
for j in range(1,Nt+1):
    u(0,j) = g1(j*dt)
    u(Nx,j) = g2(j*dt)
