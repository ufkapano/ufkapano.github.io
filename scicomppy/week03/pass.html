<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>'pass' is a keyword and an entire statement.
This statement doesnâ€™t do anything.
It is used when a statement is required syntactically 
but you do not want any code to execute.

<p>Use cases:
<br>(a) future code,
<br>(b) planning branching logic (if-elif-else),
<br>(c) commenting out code,
<br>(d) breakpoints for debuggers,
<br>(e) new exceptions, catching exceptions.

while True:   # infinite loop
    pass   # waiting for keyboard interrupt

def dummy_function():
    pass   # to complete later

class EmptyClass:
    pass   # to complete later

class InvalidPasswordError(ValueError):   # a name is important only
    pass

if x % 2 == 0:   # two cases to consider
    pass   # what to do if x is even
else:
    pass   # what to do if x is odd

if condition:
    #statement1   # commented out in debugging, because it takes a long time
    pass
else:
    statement2
