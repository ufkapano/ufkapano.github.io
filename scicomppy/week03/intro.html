<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>The simplest control flow: a sequential execution of statements.
<br>statement1
<br>statement2
<br>statement3

<h3>LEXICAL ANALYSIS</h3>

<p>A Python program is divided into a number of logical lines.
A Python program is read by a parser. 
Input to the parser is a stream of tokens, generated by the lexical analyzer.

<h3>SIMPLE STATEMENTS</h3>

<p>https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html

<p>A simple statement is comprised within a single logical line.
Several simple statements may occur on a single line separated by semicolons.

<p>Examples: expression, assignment, assert, pass, del, return, yield, raise,
break, continue, import, global, nonlocal.

<h3>COMPOUND STATEMENTS</h3>

<p>https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html

<p>Compound statements contain other statements.
In general, compound statements span multiple lines, although in simple 
incarnations a whole compound statement may be contained in one line.

<p>Examples: if, while, for, try, with, def, class.
