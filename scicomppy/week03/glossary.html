<h3>ITERABLE</h3>

<p>An iterable is an object capable of returning its members one at a time.
Examples of iterables include all sequence types (list, str, and tuple) 
and some non-sequence types (dict and file objects), 
and objects of any classes you define with an __iter__() method 
or with a __getitem__() method that implements Sequence semantics.

<h3>SEQUENCE</h3>

<p>A sequence is an iterable which supports efficient element access using 
integer indices via the __getitem__() special method and defines a __len__() method 
that returns the length of the sequence. 

<h3>ITERATOR</h3>

<p>An iterator is an object representing a stream of data.
Repeated calls to the iteratorâ€™s __next__() method [next() method in Python 2]
(or passing it to the built-in function next()) 
return successive items in the stream. 
When no more data are available a StopIteration exception is raised instead. 
At this point, the iterator object is exhausted and any further calls to the next() 
function just raise StopIteration again.

<p>Iterators are required to have an __iter__() method that returns the iterator 
object itself so every iterator is also iterable and may be used in most places 
where other iterables are accepted.

<h3>GENERATOR</h3>

<p>A generator is a function which returns a generator iterator. 
It looks like a normal function except that it contains yield expressions 
for producing a series of values.
Each yield temporarily suspends processing, remembering the location 
execution state (including local variables and pending try-statements). 
When the generator iterator resumes, it picks up where it left off 
(in contrast to functions which start fresh on every invocation).
