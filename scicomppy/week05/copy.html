<h1>Using copy</h1>

<p>https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html

<h3>INTRO</h3>

<p>This module provides generic shallow and deep copy operations.
<br>A 'shallow copy' constructs a new compound object and then 
inserts 'references' into it to the objects found in the original.
<br>A 'deep copy' constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, 
inserts 'copies' into it of the objects found in the original.

<p>Two problems with deep copy operations:
<br>(a) recursive objects may cause a recursive loop,
<br>(b) it may copy too much, such as data which is intended 
to be shared between copies.

<p>The deepcopy() function avoids these problems by:
<br>(a) keeping a 'memo' dictionary of objects already copied during 
the current copying pass,
<br>(b) letting user-defined classes override the copying operation 
or the set of components copied.
