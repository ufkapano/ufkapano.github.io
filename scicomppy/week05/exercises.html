<h3>EXERCISE 5.1</h3>

<p>For a given directory (top) find the number of bytes taken by PDF files
in the directory tree (".pdf" extensions).
The code should be in the function find_pdf_size(top).
In order to test the current directory we run find_pdf_size(".").

'date1' and 'date2' are strings of the form 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
The function prints dates of working days (from Monday to Friday)
in the given range, 'date2' is excluded.

<h3>EXERCISE 5.3</h3>

<p>Create the generator random_walk(start) for a 1D random walker.
If a position at a certain moment is x, then the next position
can be x+1 or x-1 with equal probabilities.
Find the final position after 100 moves (start=0).
