<h2 class="unnumbered">Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-introduction-1"></a>
This manual documents how to use the GNU compilers,
as well as their features and incompatibilities, and how to report
bugs.  It corresponds to GCC version 3.3.5. 
The internals of the GNU compilers, including how to port them to new
targets and some information about how to write front ends for new
languages, are documented in a separate manual.  See <a href="{No value for `fngccint'}.html#Top">Introduction (GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals)</a>.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Compile C, C++, Objective-C, Ada, Fortran, Java, or treelang</h2>

<p><a name="index-Objective_002dC-2"></a><a name="index-Fortran-3"></a><a name="index-Java-4"></a><a name="index-Ada-5"></a><a name="index-treelang-6"></a>Several versions of the compiler (C, C++, Objective-C, Ada,
Fortran, Java and treelang) are integrated; this is why we use the name
&ldquo;GNU Compiler Collection&rdquo;.  GCC can compile programs written in any of these
languages.  The Ada, Fortran, Java and treelang compilers are described in
separate manuals.

   <p><a name="index-GCC-7"></a>&ldquo;GCC&rdquo; is a common shorthand term for the GNU Compiler Collection.  This is both
the most general name for the compiler, and the name used when the
emphasis is on compiling C programs (as the abbreviation formerly
stood for &ldquo;GNU C Compiler&rdquo;).

   <p><a name="index-C_002b_002b-8"></a><a name="index-G_002b_002b-9"></a>When referring to C++ compilation, it is usual to call the compiler
&ldquo;G++&rdquo;.  Since there is only one compiler, it is also accurate to call
it &ldquo;GCC&rdquo; no matter what the language context; however, the term
&ldquo;G++&rdquo; is more useful when the emphasis is on compiling C++ programs.

   <p><a name="index-Ada-10"></a><a name="index-GNAT-11"></a>Similarly, when we talk about Ada compilation, we usually call the
compiler &ldquo;GNAT&rdquo;, for the same reasons.

   <p>We use the name &ldquo;GCC&rdquo; to refer to the compilation system as a
whole, and more specifically to the language-independent part of the
compiler.  For example, we refer to the optimization options as
affecting the behavior of &ldquo;GCC&rdquo; or sometimes just &ldquo;the compiler&rdquo;.

   <p>Front ends for other languages, such as Mercury and Pascal exist but
have not yet been integrated into GCC.  These front ends, like that for C++,
are built in subdirectories of GCC and link to it.  The result is an
integrated compiler that can compile programs written in C, C++,
Objective-C, or any of the languages for which you have installed front
ends.

   <p>In this manual, we only discuss the options for the C, Objective-C, and
C++ compilers and those of the GCC core.  Consult the documentation
of the other front ends for the options to use when compiling programs
written in other languages.

   <p><a name="index-compiler-compared-to-C_002b_002b-preprocessor-12"></a><a name="index-intermediate-C-version_002c-nonexistent-13"></a><a name="index-C-intermediate-output_002c-nonexistent-14"></a>G++ is a <em>compiler</em>, not merely a preprocessor.  G++ builds object
code directly from your C++ program source.  There is no intermediate C
version of the program.  (By contrast, for example, some other
implementations use a program that generates a C program from your C++
source.)  Avoiding an intermediate C representation of the program means
that you get better object code, and better debugging information.  The
GNU debugger, GDB, works with this information in the object code to
give you comprehensive C++ source-level editing capabilities
(see <a href="gdb.html#C">C and C++ (Debugging with GDB)</a>).

For each language compiled by GCC for which there is a standard, GCC
attempts to follow one or more versions of that standard, possibly
with some exceptions, and possibly with some extensions.

   <p>GCC supports three versions of the C standard, although support for
the most recent version is not yet complete.

   <p><a name="index-std-48"></a><a name="index-ansi-49"></a><a name="index-pedantic-50"></a><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-51"></a>The original ANSI C standard (X3.159-1989) was ratified in 1989 and
published in 1990.  This standard was ratified as an ISO standard
(ISO/IEC 9899:1990) later in 1990.  There were no technical
differences between these publications, although the sections of the
ANSI standard were renumbered and became clauses in the ISO standard. 
This standard, in both its forms, is commonly known as <dfn>C89</dfn>, or
occasionally as <dfn>C90</dfn>, from the dates of ratification.  The ANSI
standard, but not the ISO standard, also came with a Rationale
document.  To select this standard in GCC, use one of the options
<span class="option">-ansi</span>, <span class="option">-std=c89</span> or <span class="option">-std=iso9899:1990</span>; to obtain
all the diagnostics required by the standard, you should also specify
<span class="option">-pedantic</span> (or <span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span> if you want them to be
errors rather than warnings).  See <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

   <p>Errors in the 1990 ISO C standard were corrected in two Technical
Corrigenda published in 1994 and 1996.  GCC does not support the
uncorrected version.

   <p>An amendment to the 1990 standard was published in 1995.  This
amendment added digraphs and <code>__STDC_VERSION__</code> to the language,
but otherwise concerned the library.  This amendment is commonly known
as <dfn>AMD1</dfn>; the amended standard is sometimes known as <dfn>C94</dfn> or
<dfn>C95</dfn>.  To select this standard in GCC, use the option
<span class="option">-std=iso9899:199409</span> (with, as for other standard versions,
<span class="option">-pedantic</span> to receive all required diagnostics).

   <p>A new edition of the ISO C standard was published in 1999 as ISO/IEC
9899:1999, and is commonly known as <dfn>C99</dfn>.  GCC has incomplete
support for this standard version; see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/c99status.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/c99status.html</a> for details.  To select this
standard, use <span class="option">-std=c99</span> or <span class="option">-std=iso9899:1999</span>.  (While in
development, drafts of this standard version were referred to as
<dfn>C9X</dfn>.)

   <p>Errors in the 1999 ISO C standard were corrected in a Technical
Corrigendum published in 2001.  GCC does not support the uncorrected
version.

   <p>By default, GCC provides some extensions to the C language that on
rare occasions conflict with the C standard.  See <a href="#C-Extensions">Extensions to the C Language Family</a>.  Use of the
<span class="option">-std</span> options listed above will disable these extensions where
they conflict with the C standard version selected.  You may also
select an extended version of the C language explicitly with
<span class="option">-std=gnu89</span> (for C89 with GNU extensions) or <span class="option">-std=gnu99</span>
(for C99 with GNU extensions).  The default, if no C language dialect
options are given, is <span class="option">-std=gnu89</span>; this will change to
<span class="option">-std=gnu99</span> in some future release when the C99 support is
complete.  Some features that are part of the C99 standard are
accepted as extensions in C89 mode.

   <p>The ISO C standard defines (in clause 4) two classes of conforming
implementation.  A <dfn>conforming hosted implementation</dfn> supports the
whole standard including all the library facilities; a <dfn>conforming
freestanding implementation</dfn> is only required to provide certain
library facilities: those in <code>&lt;float.h&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</code>; since AMD1, also those in
<code>&lt;iso646.h&gt;</code>; and in C99, also those in <code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>.  In addition, complex types, added in C99, are not
required for freestanding implementations.  The standard also defines
two environments for programs, a <dfn>freestanding environment</dfn>,
required of all implementations and which may not have library
facilities beyond those required of freestanding implementations,
where the handling of program startup and termination are
implementation-defined, and a <dfn>hosted environment</dfn>, which is not
required, in which all the library facilities are provided and startup
is through a function <code>int main (void)</code> or <code>int main (int,
char *[])</code>.  An OS kernel would be a freestanding environment; a
program using the facilities of an operating system would normally be
in a hosted implementation.

   <p><a name="index-ffreestanding-52"></a>GCC aims towards being usable as a conforming freestanding
implementation, or as the compiler for a conforming hosted
implementation.  By default, it will act as the compiler for a hosted
implementation, defining <code>__STDC_HOSTED__</code> as <code>1</code> and
presuming that when the names of ISO C functions are used, they have
the semantics defined in the standard.  To make it act as a conforming
freestanding implementation for a freestanding environment, use the
option <span class="option">-ffreestanding</span>; it will then define
<code>__STDC_HOSTED__</code> to <code>0</code> and not make assumptions about the
meanings of function names from the standard library, with exceptions
noted below.  To build an OS kernel, you may well still need to make
your own arrangements for linking and startup. 
See <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

   <p>GCC does not provide the library facilities required only of hosted
implementations, nor yet all the facilities required by C99 of
freestanding implementations; to use the facilities of a hosted
environment, you will need to find them elsewhere (for example, in the
GNU C library).  See <a href="#Standard-Libraries">Standard Libraries</a>.

   <p>Most of the compiler support routines used by GCC are present in
<span class="file">libgcc</span>, but there are a few exceptions.  GCC requires the
freestanding environment provide <code>memcpy</code>, <code>memmove</code>,
<code>memset</code> and <code>memcmp</code>.  Some older ports of GCC are
configured to use the BSD <code>bcopy</code>, <code>bzero</code> and <code>bcmp</code>
functions instead, but this is deprecated for new ports. 
Finally, if <code>__builtin_trap</code> is used, and the target does
not implement the <code>trap</code> pattern, then GCC will emit a call
to <code>abort</code>.

<!-- FIXME: details of C++ standard. -->
<p>There is no formal written standard for Objective-C.  The most
authoritative manual is &ldquo;Object-Oriented Programming and the
Objective-C Language&rdquo;, available at a number of web sites

   <p><a name="index-treelang-53"></a>There is no standard for treelang, which is a sample language front end
for GCC. Its only purpose is as a sample for people wishing to write a
new language for GCC. The language is documented in

<h2 class="chapter">3 GCC Command Options</h2>

<p><a name="index-GCC-command-options-54"></a><a name="index-command-options-55"></a><a name="index-options_002c-GCC-command-56"></a>
<!-- man begin DESCRIPTION -->
When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The &ldquo;overall options&rdquo; allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <span class="option">-c</span> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.

   <p>Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.

   <p><a name="index-C-compilation-options-57"></a>Most of the command line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.

   <p><a name="index-C_002b_002b-compilation-options-58"></a>See <a href="#Invoking-G_002b_002b">Compiling C++ Programs</a>, for a summary of special
options for compiling C++ programs.

   <p><a name="index-grouping-options-59"></a><a name="index-options_002c-grouping-60"></a>The <span class="command">gcc</span> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <em>not</em> be grouped: <span class="option">-dr</span> is very different from <span class="samp">-d&nbsp;-r</span><!-- /@w -->.

   <p><a name="index-order-of-options-61"></a><a name="index-options_002c-order-62"></a>You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify <span class="option">-L</span> more than once,
the directories are searched in the order specified.

   <p>Many options have long names starting with <span class="samp">-f</span> or with
<span class="samp">-W</span>&mdash;for example, <span class="option">-fforce-mem</span>,
<span class="option">-fstrength-reduce</span>, <span class="option">-Wformat</span> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<span class="option">-ffoo</span> would be <span class="option">-fno-foo</span>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Options Controlling the Kind of Output</h3>

<p>Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  The first three
stages apply to an individual source file, and end by producing an
object file; linking combines all the object files (those newly
compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.

   <p><a name="index-file-name-suffix-63"></a>For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.m</code><dd>Objective-C source code.  Note that you must link with the library
<span class="file">libobjc.a</span> to make an Objective-C program work.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.mi</code><dd>Objective-C source code which should not be preprocessed.

Note that in <span class="samp">.cxx</span>,
the last two letters must both be literally <span class="samp">x</span>.  Likewise,
<span class="samp">.C</span> refers to a literal capital C.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.f</code><dt><var>file</var><code>.for</code><dt><var>file</var><code>.FOR</code><dd>Fortran source code which should not be preprocessed.

     <br><dt><var>file</var><code>.r</code><dd>Fortran source code which must be preprocessed with a RATFOR
preprocessor (not included with GCC).

     <p>See <a href="{No value for `fng77'}.html#Overall-Options">Options Controlling the Kind of Output (Using and Porting GNU Fortran)</a>, for more details of the handling of
Fortran input files.

</dl>

   <p><a name="index-x-64"></a>You can specify the input language explicitly with the <span class="option">-x</span> option:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-x </code><var>language</var><dd>Specify explicitly the <var>language</var> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next <span class="option">-x</span> option.  Possible values for <var>language</var> are:
     <pre class="example">          c  c-header  cpp-output
          c++  c++-cpp-output
          objective-c  objc-cpp-output
          assembler  assembler-with-cpp
          ada
          f77  f77-cpp-input  ratfor
          java
          treelang
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-x none</code><dd>Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <span class="option">-x</span>
has not been used at all).

     <br><dt><code>-pass-exit-codes</code><dd><a name="index-pass_002dexit_002dcodes-65"></a>Normally the <span class="command">gcc</span> program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
<span class="option">-pass-exit-codes</span>, the <span class="command">gcc</span> program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication. 
</dl>

   <p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<span class="option">-x</span> (or filename suffixes) to tell <span class="command">gcc</span> where to start, and
one of the options <span class="option">-c</span>, <span class="option">-S</span>, or <span class="option">-E</span> to say where
<span class="command">gcc</span> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
<span class="samp">-x cpp-output -E</span>) instruct <span class="command">gcc</span> to do nothing at all.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-c</code><dd><a name="index-c-66"></a>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.

     <p>By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <span class="samp">.c</span>, <span class="samp">.i</span>, <span class="samp">.s</span>, etc., with <span class="samp">.o</span>.

     <p>Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-S</code><dd><a name="index-S-67"></a>Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.

     <p>By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <span class="samp">.c</span>, <span class="samp">.i</span>, etc., with <span class="samp">.s</span>.

     <p>Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-E</code><dd><a name="index-E-68"></a>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.

     <p>Input files which don't require preprocessing are ignored.

     <p><a name="index-output-file-option-69"></a><br><dt><code>-o </code><var>file</var><dd><a name="index-o-70"></a>Place output in file <var>file</var>.  This applies regardless to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

     <p>Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make sense to
use <span class="option">-o</span> when compiling more than one input file, unless you are
producing an executable file as output.

     <p>If <span class="option">-o</span> is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
in <span class="file">a.out</span>, the object file for <var>source</var><span class="file">.</span><var>suffix</var> in
<var>source</var><span class="file">.o</span>, its assembler file in <var>source</var><span class="file">.s</span>, and
all preprocessed C source on standard output.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd><a name="index-v-71"></a>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages

program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.

the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
no trouble.

     <br><dt><code>--help</code><dd><a name="index-help-74"></a>Print (on the standard output) a description of the command line options

then <span class="option">--help</span> will also be passed on to the various processes
invoked by <span class="command">gcc</span>, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the <span class="option">-W</span> option is also specified then command
line options which have no documentation associated with them will also
be displayed.

<p><a name="index-suffixes-for-C_002b_002b-source-77"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-source-file-suffixes-78"></a>C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <span class="samp">.C</span>,
<span class="samp">.cc</span>, <span class="samp">.cpp</span>, <span class="samp">.c++</span>, <span class="samp">.cp</span>, or <span class="samp">.cxx</span>;
preprocessed C++ files use the suffix <span class="samp">.ii</span>.  GCC recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with
the name <span class="command">gcc</span>).

   <p><a name="index-g_002b_002b-79"></a><a name="index-c_002b_002b-80"></a>However, C++ programs often require class libraries as well as a
compiler that understands the C++ language&mdash;and under some
circumstances, you might want to compile programs from standard input,
or otherwise without a suffix that flags them as C++ programs. 
<span class="command">g++</span> is a program that calls GCC with the default language
set to C++, and automatically specifies linking against the C++
library.  On many systems, <span class="command">g++</span> is also

   <p><a name="index-invoking-_0040command_007bg_002b_002b_007d-81"></a>When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same

<h3 class="section">3.4 Options Controlling C Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-dialect-options-82"></a><a name="index-language-dialect-options-83"></a><a name="index-options_002c-dialect-84"></a>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++ and Objective-C) that the compiler accepts:

     
<a name="index-ANSI-support-85"></a>
<a name="index-ISO-support-86"></a>
<dl><dt><code>-ansi</code><dd><a name="index-ansi-87"></a>In C mode, support all ISO C90 programs.  In C++ mode,
remove GNU extensions that conflict with ISO C++.

     <p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling C++ code),
such as the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <code>unix</code> and <code>vax</code> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++ style <span class="samp">//</span> comments as well as
the <code>inline</code> keyword.

     <p>The alternate keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__extension__</code>,
<code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code> continue to work despite
<span class="option">-ansi</span>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <span class="option">-ansi</span>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <code>__unix__</code> and <code>__vax__</code> are also available, with or
without <span class="option">-ansi</span>.

     <p>The <span class="option">-ansi</span> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <span class="option">-pedantic</span> is required in
addition to <span class="option">-ansi</span>.  See <a href="#Warning-Options">Warning Options</a>.

     <p>The macro <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> is predefined when the <span class="option">-ansi</span>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.

     <p>Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as <code>alloca</code> and <code>ffs</code>) are not built-in
functions with <span class="option">-ansi</span> is used.  See <a href="#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions
affected.

     <br><dt><code>-std=</code><dd><a name="index-std-88"></a>Determine the language standard.  This option is currently only
supported when compiling C or C++.  A value for this option must be
provided; possible values are

<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/c99status.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/c99status.html</a><!-- /@w --> for more information.  The
names <span class="samp">c9x</span> and <span class="samp">iso9899:199x</span> are deprecated.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">gnu89</span><dd>Default, ISO C90 plus GNU extensions (including some C99 features).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">gnu99</span><dt><span class="samp">gnu9x</span><dd>ISO C99 plus GNU extensions.  When ISO C99 is fully implemented in GCC,
this will become the default.  The name <span class="samp">gnu9x</span> is deprecated.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">c++98</span><dd>The 1998 ISO C++ standard plus amendments.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">gnu++98</span><dd>The same as <span class="option">-std=c++98</span> plus GNU extensions.  This is the
default for C++ code. 
</dl>

     <p>Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the
features of newer standards in so far as they do not conflict with
previous C standards.  For example, you may use <code>__restrict__</code> even
when <span class="option">-std=c99</span> is not specified.

     <p>The <span class="option">-std</span> options specifying some version of ISO C have the same
effects as <span class="option">-ansi</span>, except that features that were not in ISO C90
but are in the specified version (for example, <span class="samp">//</span> comments and
the <code>inline</code> keyword in ISO C99) are not disabled.

     <p>See <a href="#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of
these standard versions.

     <br><dt><code>-aux-info </code><var>filename</var><dd><a name="index-aux_002dinfo-89"></a>Output to the given filename prototyped declarations for all functions
declared and/or defined in a translation unit, including those in header
files.  This option is silently ignored in any language other than C.

     <p>Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<span class="samp">I</span>, <span class="samp">N</span> for new or
<span class="samp">O</span> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a
definition (<span class="samp">C</span> or <span class="samp">F</span>, respectively, in the following
character).  In the case of function definitions, a K&amp;R-style list of
arguments followed by their declarations is also provided, inside
comments, after the declaration.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-asm</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dasm-90"></a>Do not recognize <code>asm</code>, <code>inline</code> or <code>typeof</code> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <code>__asm__</code>, <code>__inline__</code> and <code>__typeof__</code>
instead.  <span class="option">-ansi</span> implies <span class="option">-fno-asm</span>.

     <p>In C++, this switch only affects the <code>typeof</code> keyword, since
<code>asm</code> and <code>inline</code> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <span class="option">-fno-gnu-keywords</span> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<span class="option">-std=c99</span> or <span class="option">-std=gnu99</span>), this
switch only affects the <code>asm</code> and <code>typeof</code> keywords, since
<code>inline</code> is a standard keyword in ISO C99.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-builtin</code><dt><code>-fno-builtin-</code><var>function</var><dd><a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-91"></a><a name="index-built_002din-functions-92"></a>Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
<span class="samp">__builtin_</span> as prefix.  See <a href="#Other-Builtins">Other built-in functions provided by GCC</a>, for details of the functions affected,
including those which are not built-in functions when <span class="option">-ansi</span> or
<span class="option">-std</span> options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
do not have an ISO standard meaning.

     <p>GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <code>alloca</code> may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly, and calls to <code>memcpy</code>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.

     <p>With the <span class="option">-fno-builtin-</span><var>function</var> option
only the built-in function <var>function</var> is
disabled.  <var>function</var> must not begin with <span class="samp">__builtin_</span>.  If a
function is named this is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<span class="option">-fbuiltin-</span><var>function</var> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <span class="option">-fno-builtin</span> or
<span class="option">-ffreestanding</span>, you may define macros such as:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
          #define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-fhosted</code><dd><a name="index-fhosted-93"></a><a name="index-hosted-environment-94"></a>
Assert that compilation takes place in a hosted environment.  This implies
<span class="option">-fbuiltin</span>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <code>main</code> has a return
type of <code>int</code>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel. 
This is equivalent to <span class="option">-fno-freestanding</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-ffreestanding</code><dd><a name="index-ffreestanding-95"></a><a name="index-hosted-environment-96"></a>
Assert that compilation takes place in a freestanding environment.  This
implies <span class="option">-fno-builtin</span>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <code>main</code>.  The most obvious example is an OS kernel. 
This is equivalent to <span class="option">-fno-hosted</span>.

     <p>See <a href="#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of
freestanding and hosted environments.

     <br><dt><code>-fms-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-97"></a>Accept some non-standard constructs used in Microsoft header files.

     <br><dt><code>-trigraphs</code><dd><a name="index-trigraphs-98"></a>Support ISO C trigraphs.  The <span class="option">-ansi</span> option (and <span class="option">-std</span>
options for strict ISO C conformance) implies <span class="option">-trigraphs</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-no-integrated-cpp</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dintegrated_002dcpp-99"></a>Performs a compilation in two passes: preprocessing and compiling.  This
option allows a user supplied "cc1", "cc1plus", or "cc1obj" via the
<span class="option">-B</span> option. The user supplied compilation step can then add in
an additional preprocessing step after normal preprocessing but before
compiling. The default is to use the integrated cpp (internal cpp)

     <p>The semantics of this option will change if "cc1", "cc1plus", and
"cc1obj" are merged.

     <p><a name="index-traditional-C-language-100"></a><a name="index-C-language_002c-traditional-101"></a><br><dt><code>-traditional</code><dt><code>-traditional-cpp</code><dd><a name="index-traditional_002dcpp-102"></a><a name="index-traditional-103"></a>Formerly, these options caused GCC to attempt to emulate a pre-standard
C compiler.  They are now only supported with the <span class="option">-E</span> switch. 
The preprocessor continues to support a pre-standard mode.  See the GNU
CPP manual for details.

     <br><dt><code>-fcond-mismatch</code><dd><a name="index-fcond_002dmismatch-104"></a>Allow conditional expressions with mismatched types in the second and
third arguments.  The value of such an expression is void.  This option
is not supported for C++.

     <br><dt><code>-funsigned-char</code><dd><a name="index-funsigned_002dchar-105"></a>Let the type <code>char</code> be unsigned, like <code>unsigned char</code>.

     <p>Each kind of machine has a default for what <code>char</code> should
be.  It is either like <code>unsigned char</code> by default or like
<code>signed char</code> by default.

     <p>Ideally, a portable program should always use <code>signed char</code> or
<code>unsigned char</code> when it depends on the signedness of an object. 
But many programs have been written to use plain <code>char</code> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.

     <p>The type <code>char</code> is always a distinct type from each of
<code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.

     <br><dt><code>-fsigned-char</code><dd><a name="index-fsigned_002dchar-106"></a>Let the type <code>char</code> be signed, like <code>signed char</code>.

     <p>Note that this is equivalent to <span class="option">-fno-unsigned-char</span>, which is
the negative form of <span class="option">-funsigned-char</span>.  Likewise, the option
<span class="option">-fno-signed-char</span> is equivalent to <span class="option">-funsigned-char</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsigned-bitfields</code><dt><code>-funsigned-bitfields</code><dt><code>-fno-signed-bitfields</code><dt><code>-fno-unsigned-bitfields</code><dd><a name="index-fsigned_002dbitfields-107"></a><a name="index-funsigned_002dbitfields-108"></a><a name="index-fno_002dsigned_002dbitfields-109"></a><a name="index-fno_002dunsigned_002dbitfields-110"></a>These options control whether a bit-field is signed or unsigned, when the
declaration does not use either <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code>.  By
default, such a bit-field is signed, because this is consistent: the
basic integer types such as <code>int</code> are signed types.

     <br><dt><code>-fwritable-strings</code><dd><a name="index-fwritable_002dstrings-111"></a>Store string constants in the writable data segment and don't uniquize
them.  This is for compatibility with old programs which assume they can
write into string constants.

     <p>Writing into string constants is a very bad idea; &ldquo;constants&rdquo; should
be constant.

<h3 class="section">3.5 Options Controlling C++ Dialect</h3>

<p><a name="index-compiler-options_002c-C_002b_002b-112"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-options_002c-command-line-113"></a><a name="index-options_002c-C_002b_002b-114"></a>This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++ programs; but you can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <code>firstClass.C</code> like this:

<pre class="example">     g++ -g -frepo -O -c firstClass.C
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, only <span class="option">-frepo</span> is an option meant
only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.

   <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fabi-version=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fabi_002dversion-115"></a>Use version <var>n</var> of the C++ ABI.  Version 1 is the version of the C++
ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.  Version 0 will always be the
version that conforms most closely to the C++ ABI specification. 
Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will change as ABI bugs are
fixed.

     <p>The default is version 1.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-access-control</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002daccess_002dcontrol-116"></a>Turn off all access checking.  This switch is mainly useful for working
around bugs in the access control code.

     <br><dt><code>-fcheck-new</code><dd><a name="index-fcheck_002dnew-117"></a>Check that the pointer returned by <code>operator new</code> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++ standard specifies that
<code>operator new</code> will only return <code>0</code> if it is declared
<span class="samp">throw()</span>, in which case the compiler will always check the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<code>operator new</code> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <code>std::bad_alloc</code>.  See also
<span class="samp">new (nothrow)</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fconserve-space</code><dd><a name="index-fconserve_002dspace-118"></a>Put uninitialized or runtime-initialized global variables into the
common segment, as C does.  This saves space in the executable at the
cost of not diagnosing duplicate definitions.  If you compile with this
flag and your program mysteriously crashes after <code>main()</code> has
completed, you may have an object that is being destroyed twice because
two definitions were merged.

     <p>This option is no longer useful on most targets, now that support has
been added for putting variables into BSS without making them common.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-const-strings</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dconst_002dstrings-119"></a>Give string constants type <code>char *</code> instead of type <code>const
char *</code>.  By default, G++ uses type <code>const char *</code> as required by
the standard.  Even if you use <span class="option">-fno-const-strings</span>, you cannot
actually modify the value of a string constant, unless you also use
<span class="option">-fwritable-strings</span>.

     <p>This option might be removed in a future release of G++.  For maximum
portability, you should structure your code so that it works with
string constants that have type <code>const char *</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fdollars-in-identifiers</code><dd><a name="index-fdollars_002din_002didentifiers-120"></a>Accept <span class="samp">$</span> in identifiers.  You can also explicitly prohibit use of
<span class="samp">$</span> with the option <span class="option">-fno-dollars-in-identifiers</span>.  (GNU C allows
<span class="samp">$</span> by default on most target systems, but there are a few exceptions.) 
Traditional C allowed the character <span class="samp">$</span> to form part of
identifiers.  However, ISO C and C++ forbid <span class="samp">$</span> in identifiers.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-elide-constructors</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002delide_002dconstructors-121"></a>The C++ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
which is only used to initialize another object of the same type. 
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-enforce-eh-specs</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002denforce_002deh_002dspecs-122"></a>Don't check for violation of exception specifications at runtime.  This
option violates the C++ standard, but may be useful for reducing code
size in production builds, much like defining <span class="samp">NDEBUG</span>.  The compiler
will still optimize based on the exception specifications.

     <br><dt><code>-fexternal-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fexternal_002dtemplates-123"></a>
Cause <span class="samp">#pragma interface</span> and <span class="samp">implementation</span> to apply to
template instantiation; template instances are emitted or not according
to the location of the template definition.  See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <p>This option is deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-falt-external-templates</code><dd><a name="index-falt_002dexternal_002dtemplates-124"></a>Similar to <span class="option">-fexternal-templates</span>, but template instances are
emitted or not according to the place where they are first instantiated. 
See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <p>This option is deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-ffor-scope</code><dt><code>-fno-for-scope</code><dd><a name="index-ffor_002dscope-125"></a><a name="index-fno_002dfor_002dscope-126"></a>If <span class="option">-ffor-scope</span> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> is limited to the <span class="samp">for</span> loop itself,
as specified by the C++ standard. 
If <span class="option">-fno-for-scope</span> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <i>for-init-statement</i> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++.

     <p>The default if neither flag is given to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-gnu-keywords</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dgnu_002dkeywords-127"></a>Do not recognize <code>typeof</code> as a keyword, so that code can use this
word as an identifier.  You can use the keyword <code>__typeof__</code> instead. 
<span class="option">-ansi</span> implies <span class="option">-fno-gnu-keywords</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dtemplates-128"></a>Never emit code for non-inline templates which are instantiated
implicitly (i.e. by use); only emit code for explicit instantiations. 
See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implicit-inline-templates</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dinline_002dtemplates-129"></a>Don't emit code for implicit instantiations of inline templates, either. 
The default is to handle inlines differently so that compiles with and
without optimization will need the same set of explicit instantiations.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-implement-inlines</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dimplement_002dinlines-130"></a>To save space, do not emit out-of-line copies of inline functions
controlled by <span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span>.  This will cause linker
errors if these functions are not inlined everywhere they are called.

     <br><dt><code>-fms-extensions</code><dd><a name="index-fms_002dextensions-131"></a>Disable pedantic warnings about constructs used in MFC, such as implicit
int and getting a pointer to member function via non-standard syntax.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-nonansi-builtins</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dnonansi_002dbuiltins-132"></a>Disable built-in declarations of functions that are not mandated by
ANSI/ISO C.  These include <code>ffs</code>, <code>alloca</code>, <code>_exit</code>,
<code>index</code>, <code>bzero</code>, <code>conjf</code>, and other related functions.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-operator-names</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002doperator_002dnames-133"></a>Do not treat the operator name keywords <code>and</code>, <code>bitand</code>,
<code>bitor</code>, <code>compl</code>, <code>not</code>, <code>or</code> and <code>xor</code> as
synonyms as keywords.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-optional-diags</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002doptional_002ddiags-134"></a>Disable diagnostics that the standard says a compiler does not need to
issue.  Currently, the only such diagnostic issued by G++ is the one for
a name having multiple meanings within a class.

     <br><dt><code>-fpermissive</code><dd><a name="index-fpermissive-135"></a>Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to
warnings.  Thus, using <span class="option">-fpermissive</span> will allow some
nonconforming code to compile.

     <br><dt><code>-frepo</code><dd><a name="index-frepo-136"></a>Enable automatic template instantiation at link time.  This option also
implies <span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span>.  See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>, for more information.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-rtti</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002drtti-137"></a>Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++ runtime type identification features
(<span class="samp">dynamic_cast</span> and <span class="samp">typeid</span>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but it will generate it as
needed.

     <br><dt><code>-fstats</code><dd><a name="index-fstats-138"></a>Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation. 
This information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.

     <br><dt><code>-ftemplate-depth-</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-ftemplate_002ddepth-139"></a>Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <var>n</var>. 
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17.

     <br><dt><code>-fuse-cxa-atexit</code><dd><a name="index-fuse_002dcxa_002datexit-140"></a>Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
<code>__cxa_atexit</code> function rather than the <code>atexit</code> function. 
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but will only work if your C library supports
<code>__cxa_atexit</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fvtable-gc</code><dd><a name="index-fvtable_002dgc-141"></a>Emit special relocations for vtables and virtual function references
so that the linker can identify unused virtual functions and zero out
vtable slots that refer to them.  This is most useful with
<span class="option">-ffunction-sections</span> and <span class="option">-Wl,--gc-sections</span>, in order to
also discard the functions themselves.

     <p>This optimization requires GNU as and GNU ld.  Not all systems support
this option.  <span class="option">-Wl,--gc-sections</span> is ignored without <span class="option">-static</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-weak</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dweak-142"></a>Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker. 
By default, G++ will use weak symbols if they are available.  This
option exists only for testing, and should not be used by end-users;
it will result in inferior code and has no benefits.  This option may
be removed in a future release of G++.

     <br><dt><code>-nostdinc++</code><dd><a name="index-nostdinc_002b_002b-143"></a>Do not search for header files in the standard directories specific to
C++, but do still search the other standard directories.  (This option
is used when building the C++ library.) 
</dl>

   <p>In addition, these optimization, warning, and code generation options
have meanings only for C++ programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fno-default-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefault_002dinline-144"></a>Do not assume <span class="samp">inline</span> for functions defined inside a class scope. 
See <a href="#Optimize-Options">Options That Control Optimization</a>.  Note that these
functions will have linkage like inline functions; they just won't be
inlined by default.

     <br><dt><code>-Wabi </code><span class="roman">(C++ only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wabi-145"></a>Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral C++ ABI.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
will be compatible.

     <p>You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.

     <p>The known incompatibilities at this point include:

          <ul>
<li>Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
               struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">In this case, G++ will place <code>B::f2</code> into the same byte
as<code>A::f1</code>; other compilers will not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding <code>A</code> so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that will cause G++ and other compilers to
layout <code>B</code> identically.

          <li>Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
               struct B { B(); char c2; };
               struct C : public A, public virtual B {};
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">In this case, G++ will not place <code>B</code> into the tail-padding for
<code>A</code>; other compilers will.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding <code>A</code> so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that will cause G++ and other
compilers to layout <code>C</code> identically.

          <li>Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               union U { int i : 4096; };
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">Assuming that an <code>int</code> does not have 4096 bits, G++ will make the
union too small by the number of bits in an <code>int</code>.

          <li>Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct A {};
               
               struct B {
                 A a;
                 virtual void f ();
               };
               
               struct C : public B, public A {};
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">G++ will place the <code>A</code> base class of <code>C</code> at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
<code>A</code> data member of <code>B</code> is already at offset zero.

          <li>Names of template functions whose types involve <code>typename</code> or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.

          <pre class="smallexample">               template &lt;typename Q&gt;
               void f(typename Q::X) {}
               
               template &lt;template &lt;typename&gt; class Q&gt;
               void f(typename Q&lt;int&gt;::X) {}
          </pre>
          <p class="noindent">Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.

     </ul>

          <ul>
<li>Item 6:  Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and

within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
<span class="samp">friend foo(int)</span>), the C++ language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, <span class="option">-Wnon-template-friend</span> allows the compiler to
check existing code for potential trouble spots and is on by default. 
This new compiler behavior can be turned off with
<span class="option">-Wno-non-template-friend</span> which keeps the conformant compiler code

for Objective-C programs, but you can also use most of the GNU compiler
options regardless of what language your program is in.  For example,
you might compile a file <code>some_class.m</code> like this:

<pre class="example">     gcc -g -fgnu-runtime -O -c some_class.m
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this example, <span class="option">-fgnu-runtime</span> is an option meant only for
Objective-C programs; you can use the other options with any language
supported by GCC.

   <p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling Objective-C
programs:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fconstant-string-class=</code><var>class-name</var><dd><a name="index-fconstant_002dstring_002dclass-166"></a>Use <var>class-name</var> as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax <code>@"..."</code>.  The default
class name is <code>NXConstantString</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-fgnu-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-fgnu_002druntime-167"></a>Generate object code compatible with the standard GNU Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.

     <br><dt><code>-fnext-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-fnext_002druntime-168"></a>Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac OS X.  The macro
<code>__NEXT_RUNTIME__</code> is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.

     <br><dt><code>-gen-decls</code><dd><a name="index-gen_002ddecls-169"></a>Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a
file named <var>sourcename</var><span class="file">.decl</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-protocol</code><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dprotocol-170"></a>If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the <code>-Wno-protocol</code> option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.

     <br><dt><code>-Wselector</code><dd><a name="index-Wselector-171"></a>Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a <code>@selector(...)</code>
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the <code>-fsyntax-only</code> option is
being used.

     <br><dt><code>-Wundeclared-selector</code><dd><a name="index-Wundeclared_002dselector-172"></a>Warn if a <code>@selector(...)</code> expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
<code>@selector(...)</code> expression, either explicitly in an
<code>@interface</code> or <code>@protocol</code> declaration, or implicitly in
an <code>@implementation</code> section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a <code>@selector(...)</code> expression is found,
while <code>-Wselector</code> only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.

<p><a name="index-options-to-control-diagnostics-formatting-173"></a><a name="index-diagnostic-messages-174"></a><a name="index-message-formatting-175"></a>
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, <small class="dots">...</small>).  The options described
below can be used to control the diagnostic messages formatting
algorithm, e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Right now, only the C++ front end can
honor these options.  However it is expected, in the near future, that
the remaining front ends would be able to digest them correctly.

characters.  The default is 72 characters for <span class="command">g++</span> and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by GCC.  If <var>n</var> is zero, then no
line-wrapping will be done; each error message will appear on a single
line.

over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</code><dd>Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as

Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.

   <p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning <span class="samp">-W</span>,
for example <span class="option">-Wimplicit</span> to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning <span class="samp">-Wno-</span> to turn off warnings;
for example, <span class="option">-Wno-implicit</span>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.

   <p>The following options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced
by GCC; for further, language-specific options also refer to

these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.

     <p>Some users try to use <span class="option">-pedantic</span> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all&mdash;only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.

     <p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <span class="option">-pedantic</span>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.

     <p>Where the standard specified with <span class="option">-std</span> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as <span class="samp">gnu89</span> or <span class="samp">gnu99</span>, there is a
corresponding <dfn>base standard</dfn>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <span class="option">-pedantic</span> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

     <p>The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well

is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.

     <p>Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<code>if</code> statement an <code>else</code> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            if (a)
              if (b)
                foo ();
            else
              bar ();
          }
     </pre>
     <p>In C, every <code>else</code> branch belongs to the innermost possible <code>if</code>
statement, which in this example is <code>if (b)</code>.  This is often not
what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by
indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
confusion, GCC will issue a warning when this flag is specified. 
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost
<code>if</code> statement so there is no way the <code>else</code> could belong to
the enclosing <code>if</code>.  The resulting code would look like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            if (a)
              {
                if (b)
                  foo ();
                else
                  bar ();
              }
          }
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-Wsequence-point</code><dd><a name="index-Wsequence_002dpoint-205"></a>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C standard.

     <p>The C standard defines the order in which expressions in a C program are
evaluated in terms of <dfn>sequence points</dfn>, which represent a partial
ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those executed
before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These occur
after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a
larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places. 
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.

     <p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C standard specifies that &ldquo;Between the
previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value
modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore,
the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be
stored.&rdquo;.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

     <p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.

     <p>The present implementation of this option only works for C programs.  A
future implementation may also work for C++ programs.

     <p>The C standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.

definitions, may be found on our readings page, at

     <p>These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you don't specify <span class="option">-O</span>, you simply won't
get these warnings.

     <p>These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable that
is declared <code>volatile</code>, or whose address is taken, or whose size
is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.

     <p>Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.

     <p>These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            int x;
            switch (y)
              {

                break;
              case 3: x = 5;
              }
            foo (x);
          }
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:

     <pre class="smallexample">          {
            int save_y;
            if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
            ...
            if (change_y) y = save_y;
          }
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">This has no bug because <code>save_y</code> is used only if it is set.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-warnings-218"></a>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <code>longjmp</code>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.

     <p>The compiler sees only the calls to <code>setjmp</code>.  It cannot know
where <code>longjmp</code> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <code>longjmp</code> cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.

     <p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <code>noreturn</code>.  See <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-W</code><dd><a name="index-W-225"></a>Print extra warning messages for these events:

          <ul>
<li>A function can return either with or without a value.  (Falling
off the end of the function body is considered returning without
a value.)  For example, this function would evoke such a
warning:

          <pre class="smallexample">               foo (a)
               {
                 if (a &gt; 0)
                   return a;
               }
          </pre>
          <li>An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma expression
contains no side effects. 
To suppress the warning, cast the unused expression to void. 
For example, an expression such as <span class="samp">x[i,j]</span> will cause a warning,
but <span class="samp">x[(void)i,j]</span> will not.

          <li>An unsigned value is compared against zero with <span class="samp">&lt;</span> or <span class="samp">&gt;=</span>.

          <li>A comparison like <span class="samp">x&lt;=y&lt;=z</span> appears; this is equivalent to
<span class="samp">(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</span>, which is a different interpretation from
that of ordinary mathematical notation.

          <li>Storage-class specifiers like <code>static</code> are not the first things in
a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this usage is obsolescent.

          <li>The return type of a function has a type qualifier such as <code>const</code>. 
Such a type qualifier has no effect, since the value returned by a
function is not an lvalue.  (But don't warn about the GNU extension of
<code>volatile void</code> return types.  That extension will be warned about
if <span class="option">-pedantic</span> is specified.)

          <li>If <span class="option">-Wall</span> or <span class="option">-Wunused</span> is also specified, warn about unused
arguments.

          <li>A comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce an
incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned. 
(But don't warn if <span class="option">-Wno-sign-compare</span> is also specified.)

          <li>An aggregate has a partly bracketed initializer. 
For example, the following code would evoke such a warning,
because braces are missing around the initializer for <code>x.h</code>:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct s { int f, g; };
               struct t { struct s h; int i; };
               struct t x = { 1, 2, 3 };
          </pre>
          <li>An aggregate has an initializer which does not initialize all members. 
For example, the following code would cause such a warning, because
<code>x.h</code> would be implicitly initialized to zero:

          <pre class="smallexample">               struct s { int f, g, h; };
               struct s x = { 3, 4 };
          </pre>
          </ul>

Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command line option tells
GCC to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user
code.  However, note that using <span class="option">-Wall</span> in conjunction with this
option will <em>not</em> warn about unknown pragmas in system

     <br><dt><code>-Wfloat-equal</code><dd><a name="index-Wfloat_002dequal-231"></a>Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.

     <p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the

infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

     <br><dt><code>-Wtraditional </code><span class="roman">(C only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wtraditional-232"></a>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs which should be avoided.

          <ul>
<li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body. 
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but does not in ISO C.

          <li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist. 
Traditional preprocessors would only consider a line to be a directive
if the <span class="samp">#</span> appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<span class="option">-Wtraditional</span> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but would ignore because the <span class="samp">#</span> does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<span class="samp">#pragma</span> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations would not recognize <span class="samp">#elif</span>, so it
suggests avoiding it altogether.

          <li>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

          <li>The unary plus operator.

          <li>The <span class="samp">U</span> integer constant suffix, or the <span class="samp">F</span> or <span class="samp">L</span> floating point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the <span class="samp">L</span> suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the <span class="samp">_MIN</span>/<span class="samp">_MAX</span> macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>. 
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however gcc's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

          <li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

          <li>A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

          <li>A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one. 
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

          <li>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

          <li>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

          <li>Initialization of automatic aggregates.

          <li>Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

          <li>Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

          <li>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings, for the full set use <span class="option">-Wconversion</span>.

          <li>Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features will appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a gcc extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

to functions.

     <br><dt><code>-Wbad-function-cast </code><span class="roman">(C only)</span><dd><a name="index-Wbad_002dfunction_002dcast-238"></a>Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type. 
For example, warn if <code>int malloc()</code> is cast to <code>anything *</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wcast-qual</code><dd><a name="index-Wcast_002dqual-239"></a>Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from

to an ordinary <code>char *</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wcast-align</code><dd><a name="index-Wcast_002dalign-240"></a>Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the

an <code>int *</code> on machines where integers can only be accessed at
two- or four-byte boundaries.

     <br><dt><code>-Wwrite-strings</code><dd><a name="index-Wwrite_002dstrings-241"></a>When compiling C, give string constants the type <code>const

copying the address of one into a non-<code>const</code> <code>char *</code>
pointer will get a warning; when compiling C++, warn about the
deprecated conversion from string constants to <code>char *</code>. 
These warnings will help you find at
compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but
only if you have been very careful about using <code>const</code> in
declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance;
this is why we did not make <span class="option">-Wall</span> request these warnings.

     <br><dt><code>-Wconversion</code><dd><a name="index-Wconversion-242"></a>Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.

     <p>Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the assignment
<code>x = -1</code> if <code>x</code> is unsigned.  But do not warn about explicit
casts like <code>(unsigned) -1</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-Wsign-compare</code><dd><a name="index-Wsign_002dcompare-243"></a><a name="index-warning-for-comparison-of-signed-and-unsigned-values-244"></a><a name="index-comparison-of-signed-and-unsigned-values_002c-warning-245"></a><a name="index-signed-and-unsigned-values_002c-comparison-warning-246"></a>Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce

This warning is enabled by <span class="option">-W</span>, and by <span class="option">-Wall</span>
in C++ only.

     <br><dt><code>-Waggregate-return</code><dd><a name="index-Waggregate_002dreturn-247"></a>Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or

Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.

     <br><dt><code>-Wmissing-noreturn</code><dd><a name="index-Wmissing_002dnoreturn-251"></a>Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute <code>noreturn</code>. 
Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.  Care should
be taken to manually verify functions actually do not ever return before
adding the <code>noreturn</code> attribute, otherwise subtle code generation
bugs could be introduced.  You will not get a warning for <code>main</code> in
hosted C environments.

     <br><dt><code>-Wmissing-format-attribute</code><dd><a name="index-Wmissing_002dformat_002dattribute-252"></a><a name="index-Wformat-253"></a>If <span class="option">-Wformat</span> is enabled, also warn about functions which might be
candidates for <code>format</code> attributes.  Note these are only possible
candidates, not absolute ones.  GCC will guess that <code>format</code>
attributes might be appropriate for any function that calls a function
like <code>vprintf</code> or <code>vscanf</code>, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which <code>format</code> attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.  This option has no effect unless
<span class="option">-Wformat</span> is enabled (possibly by <span class="option">-Wall</span>).

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-multichar</code><dd><a name="index-Wno_002dmultichar-254"></a><a name="index-Wmultichar-255"></a>Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (<span class="samp">'FOOF'</span>) is used. 
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.

     <br><dt><code>-Wno-deprecated-declarations</code><dd><a name="index-Wno_002ddeprecated_002ddeclarations-256"></a>Do not warn about uses of functions, variables, and types marked as

     <br><dt><code>-Wpacked</code><dd><a name="index-Wpacked-257"></a>Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure. 
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable <code>f.x</code> in <code>struct bar</code>
will be misaligned even though <code>struct bar</code> does not itself
have the packed attribute:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo {
            int x;

     <br><dt><code>-Wunreachable-code</code><dd><a name="index-Wunreachable_002dcode-261"></a>Warn if the compiler detects that code will never be executed.

     <p>This option is intended to warn when the compiler detects that at
least a whole line of source code will never be executed, because
some condition is never satisfied or because it is after a
procedure that never returns.

     <p>It is possible for this option to produce a warning even though there
are circumstances under which part of the affected line can be executed,
so care should be taken when removing apparently-unreachable code.

     <p>For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may mean that the
line is unreachable in only one inlined copy of the function.

     <p>This option is not made part of <span class="option">-Wall</span> because in a debugging
version of a program there is often substantial code which checks
correct functioning of the program and is, hopefully, unreachable
because the program does work.  Another common use of unreachable
code is to provide behavior which is selectable at compile-time.

     <br><dt><code>-Winline</code><dd><a name="index-Winline-262"></a>Warn if a function can not be inlined and it was declared as inline. 
Even with this option, the compiler will not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.

     <p>The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by <span class="option">-Winline</span> to appear or disappear.

     <br><dt><code>-Wlong-long</code><dd><a name="index-Wlong_002dlong-263"></a><a name="index-Wno_002dlong_002dlong-264"></a>Warn if <span class="samp">long long</span> type is used.  This is default.  To inhibit
the warning messages, use <span class="option">-Wno-long-long</span>.  Flags
<span class="option">-Wlong-long</span> and <span class="option">-Wno-long-long</span> are taken into account
only when <span class="option">-pedantic</span> flag is used.

     <br><dt><code>-Wdisabled-optimization</code><dd><a name="index-Wdisabled_002doptimization-265"></a>Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC's optimizers were unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC will refuse to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.

<h3 class="section">3.9 Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC</h3>

<p><a name="index-options_002c-debugging-267"></a><a name="index-debugging-information-options-268"></a>
GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-g</code><dd><a name="index-g-269"></a>Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.

     <p>On most systems that use stabs format, <span class="option">-g</span> enables use of extra
debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <span class="option">-gstabs+</span>, <span class="option">-gstabs</span>,
<span class="option">-gxcoff+</span>, <span class="option">-gxcoff</span>, <span class="option">-gdwarf-1+</span>, <span class="option">-gdwarf-1</span>,
or <span class="option">-gvms</span> (see below).

     <p>Unlike most other C compilers, GCC allows you to use <span class="option">-g</span> with
<span class="option">-O</span>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.

     <p>Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.

     <p>The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.

     <br><dt><code>-ggdb</code><dd><a name="index-ggdb-270"></a>Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available (DWARF 2, stabs, or the native format
if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all
possible.

     <br><dt><code>-gstabs</code><dd><a name="index-gstabs-271"></a>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output which is not understood by DBX or SDB. 
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler.

     <br><dt><code>-gstabs+</code><dd><a name="index-gstabs_002b-272"></a>Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program.

     <br><dt><code>-gcoff</code><dd><a name="index-gcoff-273"></a>Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is supported). 
This is the format used by SDB on most System V systems prior to
System V Release 4.

     <br><dt><code>-gxcoff</code><dd><a name="index-gxcoff-274"></a>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported). 
This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.

     <br><dt><code>-gxcoff+</code><dd><a name="index-gxcoff_002b-275"></a>Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or
refuse to read the program, and may cause assemblers other than the GNU
assembler (GAS) to fail with an error.

     <br><dt><code>-gdwarf</code><dd><a name="index-gdwarf-276"></a>Produce debugging information in DWARF version 1 format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V Release 4
systems.

     <p>This option is deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-gdwarf+</code><dd><a name="index-gdwarf_002b-277"></a>Produce debugging information in DWARF version 1 format (if that is
supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger
(GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers
crash or refuse to read the program.

     <p>This option is deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-gdwarf-2</code><dd><a name="index-gdwarf_002d2-278"></a>Produce debugging information in DWARF version 2 format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DBX on IRIX 6.

     <br><dt><code>-gvms</code><dd><a name="index-gvms-279"></a>Produce debugging information in VMS debug format (if that is
supported).  This is the format used by DEBUG on VMS systems.

     <br><dt><code>-g</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-ggdb</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gstabs</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gcoff</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gxcoff</code><var>level</var><dt><code>-gvms</code><var>level</var><dd>Request debugging information and also use <var>level</var> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.

     <p>Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.

     <p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <span class="option">-g3</span>.

     <p>Note that in order to avoid confusion between DWARF1 debug level 2,
and DWARF2, neither <span class="option">-gdwarf</span> nor <span class="option">-gdwarf-2</span> accept
a concatenated debug level.  Instead use an additional <span class="option">-g</span><var>level</var>
option to change the debug level for DWARF1 or DWARF2.

     <br><dt><code>-feliminate-dwarf2-dups</code><dd><a name="index-feliminate_002ddwarf2_002ddups-280"></a>Compress DWARF2 debugging information by eliminating duplicated
information about each symbol.  This option only makes sense when
generating DWARF2 debugging information with <span class="option">-gdwarf-2</span>.

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bprof_007d-281"></a><br><dt><code>-p</code><dd><a name="index-p-282"></a>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <span class="command">prof</span>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

     <p><a name="index-_0040command_007bgprof_007d-283"></a><br><dt><code>-pg</code><dd><a name="index-pg-284"></a>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <span class="command">gprof</span>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.

     <br><dt><code>-Q</code><dd><a name="index-Q-285"></a>Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.

     <br><dt><code>-ftime-report</code><dd><a name="index-ftime_002dreport-286"></a>Makes the compiler print some statistics about the time consumed by each
pass when it finishes.

     <br><dt><code>-fmem-report</code><dd><a name="index-fmem_002dreport-287"></a>Makes the compiler print some statistics about permanent memory
allocation when it finishes.

     <br><dt><code>-fprofile-arcs</code><dd><a name="index-fprofile_002darcs-288"></a>Instrument <dfn>arcs</dfn> during compilation to generate coverage data or
for profile-directed block ordering.  During execution the program
records how many times each branch is executed and how many times it is
taken.  When the compiled program exits it saves this data to a file
called <var>auxname</var><span class="file">.da</span> for each source file.  <var>auxname</var> is
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and
it is not the final executable, otherwise it is the basename of the
source file. In both cases any suffix is removed (e.g.  <span class="file">foo.da</span>
for input file <span class="file">dir/foo.c</span>, or <span class="file">dir/foo.da</span> for output file
specified as <span class="option">-o dir/foo.o</span>).

     <p>For profile-directed block ordering, compile the program with
<span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span> plus optimization and code generation options,
generate the arc profile information by running the program on a
selected workload, and then compile the program again with the same
optimization and code generation options plus
<span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span> (see <a href="#Optimize-Options">Options that Control Optimization</a>).

     <p>The other use of <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span> is for use with <span class="command">gcov</span>,
when it is used with the <span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span> option.

     <p>With <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span>, for each function of your program GCC
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph. 
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

     <br><dt><code>-ftest-coverage</code><dd><a name="index-ftest_002dcoverage-289"></a>Create data files for the <span class="command">gcov</span> code-coverage utility
(see <a href="#Gcov"><span class="command">gcov</span>&mdash;a Test Coverage Program</a>).  See
<span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span> option above for a description of <var>auxname</var>.

          <dl>
<dt><var>auxname</var><code>.bb</code><dd>A mapping from basic blocks to line numbers, which <span class="command">gcov</span> uses to
associate basic block execution counts with line numbers.

          <br><dt><var>auxname</var><code>.bbg</code><dd>A list of all arcs in the program flow graph.  This allows <span class="command">gcov</span>
to reconstruct the program flow graph, so that it can compute all basic
block and arc execution counts from the information in the
<var>auxname</var><span class="file">.da</span> file. 
</dl>

     <p>Use <span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span> with <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span>; the latter
option adds instrumentation to the program, which then writes
execution counts to another data file:

          <dl>
<dt><var>auxname</var><code>.da</code><dd>Runtime arc execution counts, used in conjunction with the arc
information in the file <var>auxname</var><span class="file">.bbg</span>. 
</dl>

     <p>Coverage data will map better to the source files if
<span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span> is used without optimization.

     <br><dt><code>-d</code><var>letters</var><dd><a name="index-d-290"></a>Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<var>letters</var>.  This is used for debugging the compiler.  The file names
for most of the dumps are made by appending a pass number and a word to
the <var>dumpname</var>. <var>dumpname</var> is generated from the name of the
output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file. In both cases any
suffix is removed (e.g.  <span class="file">foo.00.rtl</span> or <span class="file">foo.01.sibling</span>). 
Here are the possible letters for use in <var>letters</var>, and their

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">address</span><dd>Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not meaningful as it

     <br><dt><code>-frandom-seed=</code><var>string</var><dd><a name="index-frandom_002dstring-336"></a>This option provides a seed that GCC uses when it would otherwise use
random numbers.  At present, this is used to generate certain symbol names
that have to be different in every compiled file.

     <p>The <var>string</var> should be different for every file you compile.

     <br><dt><code>-fsched-verbose=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-fsched_002dverbose-337"></a>On targets that use instruction scheduling, this option controls the
amount of debugging output the scheduler prints.  This information is
written to standard error, unless <span class="option">-dS</span> or <span class="option">-dR</span> is
specified, in which case it is output to the usual dump
listing file, <span class="file">.sched</span> or <span class="file">.sched2</span> respectively.  However
for <var>n</var> greater than nine, the output is always printed to standard
error.

     <p>For <var>n</var> greater than zero, <span class="option">-fsched-verbose</span> outputs the
same information as <span class="option">-dRS</span>.  For <var>n</var> greater than one, it
also output basic block probabilities, detailed ready list information
and unit/insn info.  For <var>n</var> greater than two, it includes RTL
at abort point, control-flow and regions info.  And for <var>n</var> over
four, <span class="option">-fsched-verbose</span> also includes dependence info.

     <br><dt><code>-save-temps</code><dd><a name="index-save_002dtemps-338"></a>Store the usual &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling <span class="file">foo.c</span> with <span class="samp">-c -save-temps</span> would produce files
<span class="file">foo.i</span> and <span class="file">foo.s</span>, as well as <span class="file">foo.o</span>.  This creates a
preprocessed <span class="file">foo.i</span> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

     <br><dt><code>-time</code><dd><a name="index-time-339"></a>Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).  The output looks like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          # cc1 0.12 0.01
          # as 0.00 0.01
     </pre>
     <p>The first number on each line is the &ldquo;user time,&rdquo; that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is &ldquo;system time,&rdquo;
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program. 
Both numbers are in seconds.

     <br><dt><code>-print-file-name=</code><var>library</var><dd><a name="index-print_002dfile_002dname-340"></a>Print the full absolute name of the library file <var>library</var> that
would be used when linking&mdash;and don't do anything else.  With this
option, GCC does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.

     <br><dt><code>-print-multi-directory</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dmulti_002ddirectory-341"></a>Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-print-multi-lib</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dmulti_002dlib-342"></a>Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
<span class="samp">;</span>, and each switch starts with an <span class="samp">@</span> instead of the
<span class="samp">-</span>, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell-processing.

     <br><dt><code>-print-prog-name=</code><var>program</var><dd><a name="index-print_002dprog_002dname-343"></a>Like <span class="option">-print-file-name</span>, but searches for a program such as <span class="samp">cpp</span>.

     <p>This is useful when you use <span class="option">-nostdlib</span> or <span class="option">-nodefaultlibs</span>
but you do want to link with <span class="file">libgcc.a</span>.  You can do

     <pre class="example">          gcc -nostdlib <var>files</var>... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-print-search-dirs</code><dd><a name="index-print_002dsearch_002ddirs-345"></a>Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list of
program and library directories gcc will search&mdash;and don't do anything else.

     <p>This is useful when gcc prints the error message
<span class="samp">installation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory</span>. 
To resolve this you either need to put <span class="file">cpp0</span> and the other compiler
components where gcc expects to find them, or you can set the environment
variable <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span> to the directory where you installed them. 
Don't forget the trailing '/'. 
See <a href="#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpmachine</code><dd><a name="index-dumpmachine-346"></a>Print the compiler's target machine (for example,
<span class="samp">i686-pc-linux-gnu</span>)&mdash;and don't do anything else.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpversion</code><dd><a name="index-dumpversion-347"></a>Print the compiler version (for example, <span class="samp">3.0</span>)&mdash;and don't do
anything else.

     <br><dt><code>-dumpspecs</code><dd><a name="index-dumpspecs-348"></a>Print the compiler's built-in specs&mdash;and don't do anything else.  (This

<h3 class="section">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</h3>

<p><a name="index-optimize-options-349"></a><a name="index-options_002c-optimization-350"></a>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.

   <p>Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.

   <p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.

   <p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-O</code><dt><code>-O1</code><dd><a name="index-O-351"></a><a name="index-O1-352"></a>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.

     <p>With <span class="option">-O</span>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.

     <p><span class="option">-O</span> turns on the following optimization flags:
     <pre class="smallexample">          -fdefer-pop 
          -fmerge-constants 
          -fthread-jumps 
          -floop-optimize 
          -fcrossjumping 
          -fif-conversion 
          -fif-conversion2 
          -fdelayed-branch 
          -fguess-branch-probability 
          -fcprop-registers
     </pre>
     <p><span class="option">-O</span> also turns on <span class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</span> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.

     <br><dt><code>-O2</code><dd><a name="index-O2-353"></a>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The compiler does not
perform loop unrolling or function inlining when you specify <span class="option">-O2</span>. 
As compared to <span class="option">-O</span>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.

     <p><span class="option">-O2</span> turns on all optimization flags specified by <span class="option">-O</span>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
     <pre class="smallexample">          -fforce-mem 
          -foptimize-sibling-calls 
          -fstrength-reduce 
          -fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks 
          -frerun-cse-after-loop  -frerun-loop-opt 
          -fgcse   -fgcse-lm   -fgcse-sm 
          -fdelete-null-pointer-checks 
          -fexpensive-optimizations 
          -fregmove 
          -fschedule-insns  -fschedule-insns2 
          -fsched-interblock -fsched-spec 
          -fcaller-saves 
          -fpeephole2 
          -freorder-blocks  -freorder-functions 
          -fstrict-aliasing 
          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
          -falign-loops  -falign-labels
     </pre>
     <p>Please note the warning under <span class="option">-fgcse</span> about
invoking <span class="option">-O2</span> on programs that use computed gotos.

     <br><dt><code>-O3</code><dd><a name="index-O3-354"></a>Optimize yet more.  <span class="option">-O3</span> turns on all optimizations specified by
<span class="option">-O2</span> and also turns on the <span class="option">-finline-functions</span> and
<span class="option">-frename-registers</span> options.

     <br><dt><code>-O0</code><dd><a name="index-O0-355"></a>Do not optimize.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-Os</code><dd><a name="index-Os-356"></a>Optimize for size.  <span class="option">-Os</span> enables all <span class="option">-O2</span> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.

     <p><span class="option">-Os</span> disables the following optimization flags:
     <pre class="smallexample">          -falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops 
          -falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -fprefetch-loop-arrays
     </pre>
     <p>If you use multiple <span class="option">-O</span> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective. 
</dl>

   <p>Options of the form <span class="option">-f</span><var>flag</var> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <span class="option">-ffoo</span> would be <span class="option">-fno-foo</span>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing <span class="samp">no-</span>
or adding it.

   <p>The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <span class="option">-O</span> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; of
optimizations to be performed is desired.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fno-default-inline</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefault_002dinline-357"></a>Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<span class="option">-O</span><!-- /@w -->, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add <span class="samp">inline</span> in front of
the member function name.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-defer-pop</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefer_002dpop-358"></a>Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.

     <p>Disabled at levels <span class="option">-O</span>, <span class="option">-O2</span>, <span class="option">-O3</span>, <span class="option">-Os</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fforce-mem</code><dd><a name="index-fforce_002dmem-359"></a>Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not common
subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate the separate
register-load.

     <p>Enabled at levels <span class="option">-O2</span>, <span class="option">-O3</span>, <span class="option">-Os</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fforce-addr</code><dd><a name="index-fforce_002daddr-360"></a>Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
<span class="option">-fforce-mem</span> may.

     <br><dt><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code><dd><a name="index-fomit_002dframe_002dpointer-361"></a>Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <strong>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</strong>

     <p>On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <code>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</code> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  See <a href="gccint.html#Registers">Register Usage (GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals)</a>.

Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded inline.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-functions</code><dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions-364"></a>Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
integrating in this way.

     <p>If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <code>static</code>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.

     <p>Enabled at level <span class="option">-O3</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-finline-limit=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-finline_002dlimit-365"></a>By default, gcc limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows the control of this limit for functions that are explicitly marked as
inline (i.e., marked with the inline keyword or defined within the class
definition in c++).  <var>n</var> is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of <var>n</var> is 600. 
Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that
use inlining heavily such as those based on recursive templates with C++.

     <p>Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <span class="option">--param </span><var>name</var><span class="option">=</span><var>value</var>. 
The <span class="option">-finline-limit=</span><var>n</var> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:

          <dl>
 <dt><code>max-inline-insns</code><dd>  is set to <var>n</var>. 
 <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code><dd>  is set to <var>n</var>/2. 
 <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code><dd>  is set to <var>n</var>/2. 
 <br><dt><code>min-inline-insns</code><dd>  is set to 130 or <var>n</var>/4, whichever is smaller. 
 <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-rtl</code><dd>  is set to <var>n</var>. 
</dl>

     <p>Using <span class="option">-finline-limit=600</span> thus results in the default settings
for these parameters.  See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining.

     <p><em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function's size.  In no way, it represents a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-aliasing</code><dd><a name="index-fstrict_002daliasing-403"></a>Allows the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <code>unsigned int</code> can alias an <code>int</code>, but not a
<code>void*</code> or a <code>double</code>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

     <p>Pay special attention to code like this:

          }
     </pre>
     <p>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called &ldquo;type-punning&rdquo;) is common.  Even with
<span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  However, this code might not:

     </pre>
     <p>Every language that wishes to perform language-specific alias analysis
should define a function that computes, given an <code>tree</code>
node, an alias set for the node.  Nodes in different alias sets are not
allowed to alias.  For an example, see the C front-end function

   <p>The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating
point arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-ffloat-store</code><dd><a name="index-ffloat_002dstore-410"></a>Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating point value is taken from a
register or memory.

     <p><a name="index-floating-point-precision-411"></a>This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <code>double</code> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point.  Use <span class="option">-ffloat-store</span> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.

     <br><dt><code>-ffast-math</code><dd><a name="index-ffast_002dmath-412"></a>Sets <span class="option">-fno-math-errno</span>, <span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span>, <br>

     <p>This option causes the preprocessor macro <code>__FAST_MATH__</code> to be defined.

     <p>This option should never be turned on by any <span class="option">-O</span> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-math-errno</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dmath_002derrno-413"></a>Do not set ERRNO after calling math functions that are executed
with a single instruction, e.g., sqrt.  A program that relies on
IEEE exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
for speed while maintaining IEEE arithmetic compatibility.

     <p>This option should never be turned on by any <span class="option">-O</span> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on
an exact implementation of IEEE or ISO rules/specifications for
math functions.

     <p>The default is <span class="option">-fmath-errno</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-funsafe-math-optimizations</code><dd><a name="index-funsafe_002dmath_002doptimizations-414"></a>Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate IEEE or
ANSI standards.  When used at link-time, it may include libraries
or startup files that change the default FPU control word or other
similar optimizations.

     <p>This option should never be turned on by any <span class="option">-O</span> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on

     <br><dt><code>-ffinite-math-only</code><dd><a name="index-ffinite_002dmath_002donly-415"></a>Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume
that arguments and results are not NaNs or +-Infs.

     <p>This option should never be turned on by any <span class="option">-O</span> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on

     <br><dt><code>-fno-trapping-math</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dtrapping_002dmath-416"></a>Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option implies
<span class="option">-fno-signaling-nans</span>.  Setting this option may allow faster
code if one relies on &ldquo;non-stop&rdquo; IEEE arithmetic, for example.

     <p>This option should never be turned on by any <span class="option">-O</span> option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on

     <p>The default is <span class="option">-ftrapping-math</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fsignaling-nans</code><dd><a name="index-fsignaling_002dnans-417"></a>Compile code assuming that IEEE signaling NaNs may generate user-visible
traps during floating-point operations.  Setting this option disables
optimizations that may change the number of exceptions visible with
signaling NaNs.  This option implies <span class="option">-ftrapping-math</span>.

     <p>This option causes the preprocessor macro <code>__SUPPORT_SNAN__</code> to
be defined.

     <p>The default is <span class="option">-fno-signaling-nans</span>.

     <p>This option is experimental and does not currently guarantee to
disable all GCC optimizations that affect signaling NaN behavior.

     <br><dt><code>-fsingle-precision-constant</code><dd><a name="index-fsingle_002dprecision_002dconstant-418"></a>Treat floating point constant as single precision constant instead of
implicitly converting it to double precision constant.

   </dl>

   <p>The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any <span class="option">-O</span> options.  This
section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fbranch-probabilities</code><dd><a name="index-fbranch_002dprobabilities-419"></a>After running a program compiled with <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span>
(see <a href="#Debugging-Options">Options for Debugging Your Program or <span class="command">gcc</span></a>), you can compile it a second time using
<span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When the program
compiled with <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span> exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <var>sourcename</var><span class="file">.da</span> for each source
file  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.

     <p>With <span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span>, GCC puts a
<span class="samp">REG_BR_PROB</span> note on each <span class="samp">JUMP_INSN</span> and <span class="samp">CALL_INSN</span>. 
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in <span class="file">reorg.c</span>, instead of guessing which path a
branch is mostly to take, the <span class="samp">REG_BR_PROB</span> values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.

     <br><dt><code>-fnew-ra</code><dd><a name="index-fnew_002dra-420"></a>Use a graph coloring register allocator.  Currently this option is meant
only for testing.  Users should not specify this option, since it is not
yet ready for production use.

     <br><dt><code>-ftracer</code><dd><a name="index-ftracer-421"></a>Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size. This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
better job.

     <br><dt><code>-funroll-loops</code><dd><a name="index-funroll_002dloops-422"></a>Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  <span class="option">-funroll-loops</span> implies both
<span class="option">-fstrength-reduce</span> and <span class="option">-frerun-cse-after-loop</span>.  This
option makes code larger, and may or may not make it run faster.

     <br><dt><code>-funroll-all-loops</code><dd><a name="index-funroll_002dall_002dloops-423"></a>Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly. 
<span class="option">-funroll-all-loops</span> implies the same options as
<span class="option">-funroll-loops</span>,

     <br><dt><code>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</code><dd><a name="index-fprefetch_002dloop_002darrays-424"></a>If supported by the target machine, generate instructions to prefetch
memory to improve the performance of loops that access large arrays.

     <p>Disabled at level <span class="option">-Os</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-ffunction-sections</code><dt><code>-fdata-sections</code><dd><a name="index-ffunction_002dsections-425"></a><a name="index-fdata_002dsections-426"></a>Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section's name
in the output file.

     <p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the ELF object format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  AIX may have these optimizations in
the future.

     <p>Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower. 
You will not be able to use <code>gprof</code> on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and <span class="option">-g</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-fssa</code><dd><a name="index-fssa-427"></a>Perform optimizations in static single assignment form.  Each function's
flow graph is translated into SSA form, optimizations are performed, and
the flow graph is translated back from SSA form.  Users should not
specify this option, since it is not yet ready for production use.

     <br><dt><code>-fssa-ccp</code><dd><a name="index-fssa_002dccp-428"></a>Perform Sparse Conditional Constant Propagation in SSA form.  Requires
<span class="option">-fssa</span>.  Like <span class="option">-fssa</span>, this is an experimental feature.

     <br><dt><code>-fssa-dce</code><dd><a name="index-fssa_002ddce-429"></a>Perform aggressive dead-code elimination in SSA form.  Requires <span class="option">-fssa</span>. 
Like <span class="option">-fssa</span>, this is an experimental feature.

     <br><dt><code>--param </code><var>name</var><code>=</code><var>value</var><dd><a name="index-param-430"></a>In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, GCC will not inline functions
that contain more that a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command-line using the
<span class="option">--param</span> option.

     <p>The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.

     <p>In each case, the <var>value</var> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
<var>name</var> are given in the following table:

          <dl>
<dt><code>max-crossjump-edges</code><dd>The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping. 
The algorithm used by <span class="option">-fcrossjumping</span> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-insn-search</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compile time increase with probably
small improvement in executable run time.

          <br><dt><code>max-delay-slot-live-search</code><dd>When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compile time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-memory</code><dd>The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization will not be done.

          <br><dt><code>max-gcse-passes</code><dd>The maximum number of passes of GCSE to run.

          <br><dt><code>max-pending-list-length</code><dd>The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code><dd>Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc. 
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in gcc's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
will consider for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++). 
The default value is 300.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code><dd>When you use <span class="option">-finline-functions</span> (included in <span class="option">-O3</span>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler will be investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied. 
The default value is 300.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns</code><dd>The tree inliner does decrease the allowable size for single functions
to be inlined after we already inlined the number of instructions
given here by repeated inlining.  This number should be a factor of
two or more larger than the single function limit. 
Higher numbers result in better runtime performance, but incur higher
compile-time resource (CPU time, memory) requirements and result in
larger binaries.  Very high values are not advisable, as too large
binaries may adversely affect runtime performance. 
The default value is 600.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-slope</code><dd>After exceeding the maximum number of inlined instructions by repeated
inlining, a linear function is used to decrease the allowable size
for single functions.  The slope of that function is the negative
reciprocal of the number specified here. 
The default value is 32.

          <br><dt><code>min-inline-insns</code><dd>The repeated inlining is throttled more and more by the linear function
after exceeding the limit.  To avoid too much throttling, a minimum for
this function is specified here to allow repeated inlining for very small
functions even when a lot of repeated inlining already has been done. 
The default value is 130.

          <br><dt><code>max-inline-insns-rtl</code><dd>For languages that use the RTL inliner (this happens at a later stage
than tree inlining), you can set the maximum allowable size (counted
in RTL instructions) for the RTL inliner with this parameter. 
The default value is 600.

          <br><dt><code>max-unrolled-insns</code><dd>The maximum number of instructions that a loop should have if that loop
is unrolled, and if the loop is unrolled, it determines how many times
the loop code is unrolled.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-count-fraction</code><dd>Select fraction of the maximal count of repetitions of basic block in program
given basic block needs to have to be considered hot.

          <br><dt><code>hot-bb-frequency-fraction</code><dd>Select fraction of the maximal frequency of executions of basic block in
function given basic block needs to have to be considered hot

          <br><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage</code><dt><code>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</code><dd>
This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of
executed instructions is covered.  This limits unnecessary code size
expansion.

          <p>The <span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</span> is used only when profile
feedback is available.  The real profiles (as opposed to statically estimated
ones) are much less balanced allowing the threshold to be larger value.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-max-code-growth</code><dd>Stop tail duplication once code growth has reached given percentage.  This is
rather hokey argument, as most of the duplicates will be eliminated later in
cross jumping, so it may be set to much higher values than is the desired code
growth.

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio</code><dd>
Stop reverse growth when the reverse probability of best edge is less than this
threshold (in percent).

          <br><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio</code><dt><code>tracer-min-branch-ratio-feedback</code><dd>
Stop forward growth if the best edge do have probability lower than this
threshold.

          <p>Similarly to <span class="option">tracer-dynamic-coverage</span> two values are present, one for
compilation for profile feedback and one for compilation without.  The value
for compilation with profile feedback needs to be more conservative (higher) in
order to make tracer effective.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-expand</code><dd>
GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections. 
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when
RAM &gt;= 1GB.  If <code>getrlimit</code> is available, the notion of "RAM" is
the smallest of actual RAM, RLIMIT_RSS, RLIMIT_DATA and RLIMIT_AS.  If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.

          <br><dt><code>ggc-min-heapsize</code><dd>
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span>% beyond <span class="option">ggc-min-heapsize</span>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.

          <p>The default is RAM/8, with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an
upper bound of 131072 (128 megabytes).  If <code>getrlimit</code> is
available, the notion of "RAM" is the smallest of actual RAM,
RLIMIT_RSS, RLIMIT_DATA and RLIMIT_AS.  If GCC is not able to calculate
RAM on a particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this
parameter very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting
this parameter and <span class="option">ggc-min-expand</span> to zero causes a full
collection to occur at every opportunity.

<h3 class="section">3.11 Options Controlling the Preprocessor</h3>

<p><a name="index-preprocessor-options-431"></a><a name="index-options_002c-preprocessor-432"></a>
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.

   <p>If you use the <span class="option">-E</span> option, nothing is done except preprocessing. 
Some of these options make sense only together with <span class="option">-E</span> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.

   <p><a name="index-Wp-433"></a>You can use <span class="option">-Wp,</span><var>option</var> to bypass the compiler driver
and pass <var>option</var> directly through to the preprocessor.  If
<var>option</var> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
<span class="option">-Wp</span> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using <span class="option">-Wp</span> and let the driver handle the
options instead.

     <p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write

     <br><dt><code>-Wunused-macros</code><dd><a name="index-Wunused_002dmacros-446"></a>Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is <dfn>used</dfn> if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once. 
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.

     <p>Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.

     <p><strong>Note:</strong> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block. 
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
          #endif
     </pre>

suitable for <span class="command">make</span> describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <span class="command">make</span> rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from <span class="option">-include</span> or
<span class="option">-imacros</span> command line options.

     <p>Unless specified explicitly (with <span class="option">-MT</span> or <span class="option">-MQ</span>), the
object file name consists of the basename of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix.  If there are many included
files then the rule is split into several lines using <span class="samp">\</span>-newline. 
The rule has no commands.

     <p>This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
<span class="option">-dM</span>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
<span class="option">-MF</span>, or use an environment variable like
<span class="env">DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</span> (see <a href="#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>).  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.

     <p>Passing <span class="option">-M</span> to the driver implies <span class="option">-E</span>, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit <span class="option">-w</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-MM</code><dd><a name="index-MM-456"></a>Like <span class="option">-M</span> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.

     <p>This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
<span class="samp">#include</span> directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in <span class="option">-MM</span> dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.

     <br><dt><code>-MF </code><var>file</var><dd><a name="index-MF-457"></a><a name="_002dMF"></a>
When used with <span class="option">-M</span> or <span class="option">-MM</span>, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no <span class="option">-MF</span> switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.

     <p>When used with the driver options <span class="option">-MD</span> or <span class="option">-MMD</span>,
<span class="option">-MF</span> overrides the default dependency output file.

     <br><dt><code>-MG</code><dd><a name="index-MG-458"></a>In conjunction with an option such as <span class="option">-M</span> requesting
dependency generation, <span class="option">-MG</span> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<code>#include</code> directive without prepending any path.  <span class="option">-MG</span>
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.

     <p>This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.

     <br><dt><code>-MP</code><dd><a name="index-MP-459"></a>This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors <span class="command">make</span> gives if you remove header
files without updating the <span class="file">Makefile</span> to match.

     <p>This is typical output:

     <pre class="example">          test.o: test.c test.h
          
          test.h:
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-MT </code><var>target</var><dd><a name="index-MT-460"></a>
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default CPP takes the name of the main input file, including any path,
deletes any file suffix such as <span class="samp">.c</span>, and appends the platform's
usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

     <p>An <span class="option">-MT</span> option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <span class="option">-MT</span>, or use multiple <span class="option">-MT</span> options.

     <p>For example, <span class="option">-MT&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'<!-- /@w --></span> might give

     <pre class="example">          $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>-MQ </code><var>target</var><dd><a name="index-MQ-461"></a>
Same as <span class="option">-MT</span>, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  <span class="option">-MQ&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'<!-- /@w --></span> gives

     <pre class="example">          $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
     </pre>
     <p>The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
<span class="option">-MQ</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-MD</code><dd><a name="index-MD-462"></a><span class="option">-MD</span> is equivalent to <span class="option">-M -MF </span><var>file</var>, except that
<span class="option">-E</span> is not implied.  The driver determines <var>file</var> based on
whether an <span class="option">-o</span> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of <span class="file">.d</span>, otherwise it take the
basename of the input file and applies a <span class="file">.d</span> suffix.

     <p>If <span class="option">-MD</span> is used in conjunction with <span class="option">-E</span>, any
<span class="option">-o</span> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file
(but see <a href="#_002dMF">-MF</a>), but if used without <span class="option">-E</span>, each <span class="option">-o</span>
is understood to specify a target object file.

     <p>Since <span class="option">-E</span> is not implied, <span class="option">-MD</span> can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side-effect of the compilation process.

     <br><dt><code>-MMD</code><dd><a name="index-MMD-463"></a>Like <span class="option">-MD</span> except mention only user header files, not system

selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:
<span class="samp">.c</span>, <span class="samp">.cc</span>, <span class="samp">.m</span>, or <span class="samp">.S</span>.  Some other common
extensions for C++ and assembly are also recognized.  If cpp does not
recognize the extension, it will treat the file as C; this is the most
generic mode.

     <p><strong>Note:</strong> Previous versions of cpp accepted a <span class="option">-lang</span> option

conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives. 
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with <span class="option">-C</span> to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.

     <p><span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span> is implicit if the input file has one of the

causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right. 
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a

     <p>In addition to the side-effects of the <span class="option">-C</span> option, the
<span class="option">-CC</span> option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro

     <p>It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, <span class="samp">foo.o -lz bar.o</span> searches library <span class="samp">z</span>
after file <span class="file">foo.o</span> but before <span class="file">bar.o</span>.  If <span class="file">bar.o</span> refers

     <p>Normally the files found this way are library files&mdash;archive files

scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an <span class="option">-l</span> option and specifying a file name
is that <span class="option">-l</span> surrounds <var>library</var> with <span class="samp">lib</span> and <span class="samp">.a</span>

(See <a href="{No value for `fngccint'}.html#Interface">Interfacing to GCC Output (GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals)</a>,
for more discussion of <span class="file">libgcc.a</span>.) 
In most cases, you need <span class="file">libgcc.a</span> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify <span class="option">-nostdlib</span>
or <span class="option">-nodefaultlibs</span> you should usually specify <span class="option">-lgcc</span> as well. 
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC
library subroutines.  (For example, <span class="samp">__main</span>, used to ensure C++

when you specify this option.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

     <br><dt><code>-shared-libgcc</code><dt><code>-static-libgcc</code><dd><a name="index-shared_002dlibgcc-517"></a><a name="index-static_002dlibgcc-518"></a>On systems that provide <span class="file">libgcc</span> as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version respectively. 
If no shared version of <span class="file">libgcc</span> was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.

     <p>There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared <span class="file">libgcc</span> instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared <span class="file">libgcc</span>.

     <p>Therefore, the G++ and GCJ drivers automatically add
<span class="option">-shared-libgcc</span> whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because C++ and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.

     <p>If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they will not always be linked with the shared <span class="file">libgcc</span>. 
If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have a GNU linker that
does not support option <span class="option">--eh-frame-hdr</span>, it will link the shared
version of <span class="file">libgcc</span> into shared libraries by default.  Otherwise,
it will take advantage of the linker and optimize away the linking with
the shared version of <span class="file">libgcc</span>, linking with the static version of
libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to propagate through such
shared libraries, without incurring relocation costs at library load
time.

     <p>However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or GCJ driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
<span class="option">-shared-libgcc</span>, such that it is linked with the shared
<span class="file">libgcc</span>.

     <p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<span class="option">-Xlinker</span> twice, once for the option and once for the argument. 
For example, to pass <span class="option">-assert definitions</span>, you must write
<span class="samp">-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</span>.  It does not work to write
<span class="option">-Xlinker "-assert definitions"</span>, because this passes the entire

<h3 class="section">3.14 Options for Directory Search</h3>

<p><a name="index-directory-options-523"></a><a name="index-options_002c-directory-search-524"></a><a name="index-search-path-525"></a>
These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-I</code><var>dir</var><dd><a name="index-I-526"></a>Add the directory <var>dir</var> to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use <span class="option">-isystem</span> for that).  If you use more than
one <span class="option">-I</span> option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.

     <p>If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<span class="option">-isystem</span>, is also specified with <span class="option">-I</span>, the <span class="option">-I</span>
option will be ignored.  The directory will still be searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain. 
This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the include_next directive are not inadvertently changed. 
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the <span class="option">-nostdinc</span> and/or <span class="option">-isystem</span> options.

     <br><dt><code>-I-</code><dd><a name="index-I_002d-527"></a>Any directories you specify with <span class="option">-I</span> options before the <span class="option">-I-</span>
option are searched only for the case of <span class="samp">#include "</span><var>file</var><span class="samp">"</span>;
they are not searched for <span class="samp">#include &lt;</span><var>file</var><span class="samp">&gt;</span>.

     <p>If additional directories are specified with <span class="option">-I</span> options after
the <span class="option">-I-</span>, these directories are searched for all <span class="samp">#include</span>
directives.  (Ordinarily <em>all</em> <span class="option">-I</span> directories are used
this way.)

     <p>In addition, the <span class="option">-I-</span> option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for <span class="samp">#include "</span><var>file</var><span class="samp">"</span>.  There is no way to
override this effect of <span class="option">-I-</span>.  With <span class="option">-I.</span> you can specify
searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.

     <p><span class="option">-I-</span> does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, <span class="option">-I-</span> and <span class="option">-nostdinc</span> are
independent.

     <br><dt><code>-L</code><var>dir</var><dd><a name="index-L-528"></a>Add directory <var>dir</var> to the list of directories to be searched
for <span class="option">-l</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-B</code><var>prefix</var><dd><a name="index-B-529"></a>This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

     <p>The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
<span class="file">cpp</span>, <span class="file">cc1</span>, <span class="file">as</span> and <span class="file">ld</span>.  It tries
<var>prefix</var> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without <var>machine</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>version</var><span class="samp">/</span> (see <a href="#Target-Options">Target Options</a>).

     <p>For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
<span class="option">-B</span> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if <span class="option">-B</span>
was not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
<span class="file">/usr/lib/gcc/</span> and <span class="file">/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/</span>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
<span class="env">PATH</span> environment variable.

     <p>The compiler will check to see if the path provided by the <span class="option">-B</span>
refers to a directory, and if necessary it will add a directory
separator character at the end of the path.

     <p><span class="option">-B</span> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into <span class="option">-L</span> options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into <span class="option">-isystem</span> options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends <span class="samp">include</span> to the prefix.

     <p>The run-time support file <span class="file">libgcc.a</span> can also be searched for using
the <span class="option">-B</span> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.

     <p>Another way to specify a prefix much like the <span class="option">-B</span> prefix is to use
the environment variable <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span>.  See <a href="#Environment-Variables">Environment Variables</a>.

     <p>As a special kludge, if the path provided by <span class="option">-B</span> is
<span class="file">[dir/]stage</span><var>N</var><span class="file">/</span>, where <var>N</var> is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it will be replaced by <span class="file">[dir/]include</span>.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.

     <br><dt><code>-specs=</code><var>file</var><dd><a name="index-specs-530"></a>Process <var>file</var> after the compiler reads in the standard <span class="file">specs</span>

<span class="file">cc1plus</span>, <span class="file">as</span>, <span class="file">ld</span>, etc.  More than one
<span class="option">-specs=</span><var>file</var> can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.

<h3 class="section">3.15 Specifying subprocesses and the switches to pass to them</h3>

<p><a name="index-Spec-Files-531"></a>
<span class="command">gcc</span> is a driver program.  It performs its job by invoking a
sequence of other programs to do the work of compiling, assembling and
linking.  GCC interprets its command-line parameters and uses these to
deduce which programs it should invoke, and which command-line options
it ought to place on their command lines.  This behavior is controlled
by <dfn>spec strings</dfn>.  In most cases there is one spec string for each
program that GCC can invoke, but a few programs have multiple spec
strings to control their behavior.  The spec strings built into GCC can
be overridden by using the <span class="option">-specs=</span> command-line switch to specify
a spec file.

   <p><dfn>Spec files</dfn> are plaintext files that are used to construct spec
strings.  They consist of a sequence of directives separated by blank
lines.  The type of directive is determined by the first non-whitespace
character on the line and it can be one of the following:

     <dl>
<dt><code>%</code><var>command</var><dd>Issues a <var>command</var> to the spec file processor.  The commands that can
appear here are:

          <dl>
<dt><code>%include &lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code><dd><a name="index-_0025include-532"></a>Search for <var>file</var> and insert its text at the current point in the
specs file.

          <br><dt><code>%include_noerr &lt;</code><var>file</var><code>&gt;</code><dd><a name="index-_0025include_005fnoerr-533"></a>Just like <span class="samp">%include</span>, but do not generate an error message if the include
file cannot be found.

          <br><dt><code>%rename </code><var>old_name</var> <var>new_name</var><dd><a name="index-_0025rename-534"></a>Rename the spec string <var>old_name</var> to <var>new_name</var>.

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>*[</code><var>spec_name</var><code>]:</code><dd>This tells the compiler to create, override or delete the named spec
string.  All lines after this directive up to the next directive or
blank line are considered to be the text for the spec string.  If this
results in an empty string then the spec will be deleted.  (Or, if the
spec did not exist, then nothing will happened.)  Otherwise, if the spec
does not currently exist a new spec will be created.  If the spec does
exist then its contents will be overridden by the text of this
directive, unless the first character of that text is the <span class="samp">+</span>
character, in which case the text will be appended to the spec.

     <br><dt><code>[</code><var>suffix</var><code>]:</code><dd>Creates a new <span class="samp">[</span><var>suffix</var><span class="samp">] spec</span> pair.  All lines after this directive
and up to the next directive or blank line are considered to make up the
spec string for the indicated suffix.  When the compiler encounters an
input file with the named suffix, it will processes the spec string in
order to work out how to compile that file.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          .ZZ:
          z-compile -input %i
     </pre>
     <p>This says that any input file whose name ends in <span class="samp">.ZZ</span> should be
passed to the program <span class="samp">z-compile</span>, which should be invoked with the
command-line switch <span class="option">-input</span> and with the result of performing the
<span class="samp">%i</span> substitution.  (See below.)

     <p>As an alternative to providing a spec string, the text that follows a
suffix directive can be one of the following:

          <dl>
<dt><code>@</code><var>language</var><dd>This says that the suffix is an alias for a known <var>language</var>.  This is
similar to using the <span class="option">-x</span> command-line switch to GCC to specify a
language explicitly.  For example:

          <pre class="smallexample">               .ZZ:
               @c++
          </pre>
          <p>Says that .ZZ files are, in fact, C++ source files.

          <br><dt><code>#</code><var>name</var><dd>This causes an error messages saying:

          <pre class="smallexample">               <var>name</var> compiler not installed on this system.
          </pre>
          </dl>

     <p>GCC already has an extensive list of suffixes built into it. 
This directive will add an entry to the end of the list of suffixes, but
since the list is searched from the end backwards, it is effectively
possible to override earlier entries using this technique.

   </dl>

   <p>GCC has the following spec strings built into it.  Spec files can
override these strings or create their own.  Note that individual
targets can also add their own spec strings to this list.

<pre class="smallexample">     asm          Options to pass to the assembler
     asm_final    Options to pass to the assembler post-processor
     cpp          Options to pass to the C preprocessor
     cc1          Options to pass to the C compiler
     cc1plus      Options to pass to the C++ compiler
     endfile      Object files to include at the end of the link
     link         Options to pass to the linker
     lib          Libraries to include on the command line to the linker
     libgcc       Decides which GCC support library to pass to the linker
     linker       Sets the name of the linker
     predefines   Defines to be passed to the C preprocessor
     signed_char  Defines to pass to CPP to say whether <code>char</code> is signed
                  by default
     startfile    Object files to include at the start of the link
</pre>
   <p>Here is a small example of a spec file:

<pre class="smallexample">     %rename lib                 old_lib
     
     *lib:
     --start-group -lgcc -lc -leval1 --end-group %(old_lib)
</pre>
   <p>This example renames the spec called <span class="samp">lib</span> to <span class="samp">old_lib</span> and
then overrides the previous definition of <span class="samp">lib</span> with a new one. 
The new definition adds in some extra command-line options before
including the text of the old definition.

   <p><dfn>Spec strings</dfn> are a list of command-line options to be passed to their
corresponding program.  In addition, the spec strings can contain
<span class="samp">%</span>-prefixed sequences to substitute variable text or to
conditionally insert text into the command line.  Using these constructs
it is possible to generate quite complex command lines.

   <p>Here is a table of all defined <span class="samp">%</span>-sequences for spec
strings.  Note that spaces are not generated automatically around the
results of expanding these sequences.  Therefore you can concatenate them
together or combine them with constant text in a single argument.

     <dl>
<dt><code>%%</code><dd>Substitute one <span class="samp">%</span> into the program name or argument.

     <br><dt><code>%i</code><dd>Substitute the name of the input file being processed.

     <br><dt><code>%b</code><dd>Substitute the basename of the input file being processed. 
This is the substring up to (and not including) the last period
and not including the directory.

     <br><dt><code>%B</code><dd>This is the same as <span class="samp">%b</span>, but include the file suffix (text after
the last period).

     <br><dt><code>%d</code><dd>Marks the argument containing or following the <span class="samp">%d</span> as a
temporary file name, so that that file will be deleted if GCC exits
successfully.  Unlike <span class="samp">%g</span>, this contributes no text to the
argument.

     <br><dt><code>%g</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Substitute a file name that has suffix <var>suffix</var> and is chosen
once per compilation, and mark the argument in the same way as
<span class="samp">%d</span>.  To reduce exposure to denial-of-service attacks, the file
name is now chosen in a way that is hard to predict even when previously
chosen file names are known.  For example, <span class="samp">%g.s ... %g.o ... %g.s</span>
might turn into <span class="samp">ccUVUUAU.s ccXYAXZ12.o ccUVUUAU.s</span>.  <var>suffix</var> matches
the regexp <span class="samp">[.A-Za-z]*</span> or the special string <span class="samp">%O</span>, which is
treated exactly as if <span class="samp">%O</span> had been preprocessed.  Previously, <span class="samp">%g</span>
was simply substituted with a file name chosen once per compilation,
without regard to any appended suffix (which was therefore treated
just like ordinary text), making such attacks more likely to succeed.

     <br><dt><code>%u</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Like <span class="samp">%g</span>, but generates a new temporary file name even if
<span class="samp">%u</span><var>suffix</var> was already seen.

     <br><dt><code>%U</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Substitutes the last file name generated with <span class="samp">%u</span><var>suffix</var>, generating a
new one if there is no such last file name.  In the absence of any
<span class="samp">%u</span><var>suffix</var>, this is just like <span class="samp">%g</span><var>suffix</var>, except they don't share
the same suffix <em>space</em>, so <span class="samp">%g.s ... %U.s ... %g.s ... %U.s</span>
would involve the generation of two distinct file names, one
for each <span class="samp">%g.s</span> and another for each <span class="samp">%U.s</span>.  Previously, <span class="samp">%U</span> was
simply substituted with a file name chosen for the previous <span class="samp">%u</span>,
without regard to any appended suffix.

     <br><dt><code>%j</code><var>suffix</var><dd>Substitutes the name of the <code>HOST_BIT_BUCKET</code>, if any, and if it is
writable, and if save-temps is off; otherwise, substitute the name
of a temporary file, just like <span class="samp">%u</span>.  This temporary file is not
meant for communication between processes, but rather as a junk
disposal mechanism.

     <br><dt><code>%.</code><var>SUFFIX</var><dd>Substitutes <var>.SUFFIX</var> for the suffixes of a matched switch's args
when it is subsequently output with <span class="samp">%*</span>.  <var>SUFFIX</var> is
terminated by the next space or %.

     <br><dt><code>%w</code><dd>Marks the argument containing or following the <span class="samp">%w</span> as the
designated output file of this compilation.  This puts the argument
into the sequence of arguments that <span class="samp">%o</span> will substitute later.

     <br><dt><code>%o</code><dd>Substitutes the names of all the output files, with spaces
automatically placed around them.  You should write spaces
around the <span class="samp">%o</span> as well or the results are undefined. 
<span class="samp">%o</span> is for use in the specs for running the linker. 
Input files whose names have no recognized suffix are not compiled
at all, but they are included among the output files, so they will
be linked.

     <br><dt><code>%O</code><dd>Substitutes the suffix for object files.  Note that this is
handled specially when it immediately follows <span class="samp">%g, %u, or %U</span>,
because of the need for those to form complete file names.  The
handling is such that <span class="samp">%O</span> is treated exactly as if it had already
been substituted, except that <span class="samp">%g, %u, and %U</span> do not currently
support additional <var>suffix</var> characters following <span class="samp">%O</span> as they would
following, for example, <span class="samp">.o</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%p</code><dd>Substitutes the standard macro predefinitions for the
current target machine.  Use this when running <code>cpp</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%P</code><dd>Like <span class="samp">%p</span>, but puts <span class="samp">__</span> before and after the name of each
predefined macro, except for macros that start with <span class="samp">__</span> or with
<span class="samp">_</span><var>L</var>, where <var>L</var> is an uppercase letter.  This is for ISO
C.

     <br><dt><code>%I</code><dd>Substitute any of <span class="option">-iprefix</span> (made from <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span>),
<span class="option">-isysroot</span> (made from <span class="env">TARGET_SYSTEM_ROOT</span>), and
<span class="option">-isystem</span> (made from <span class="env">COMPILER_PATH</span> and <span class="option">-B</span> options)
as necessary.

     <br><dt><code>%s</code><dd>Current argument is the name of a library or startup file of some sort. 
Search for that file in a standard list of directories and substitute
the full name found.

     <br><dt><code>%e</code><var>str</var><dd>Print <var>str</var> as an error message.  <var>str</var> is terminated by a newline. 
Use this when inconsistent options are detected.

     <br><dt><code>%|</code><dd>Output <span class="samp">-</span> if the input for the current command is coming from a pipe.

     <br><dt><code>%(</code><var>name</var><code>)</code><dd>Substitute the contents of spec string <var>name</var> at this point.

     <br><dt><code>%[</code><var>name</var><code>]</code><dd>Like <span class="samp">%(...)</span> but put <span class="samp">__</span> around <span class="option">-D</span> arguments.

     <br><dt><code>%x{</code><var>option</var><code>}</code><dd>Accumulate an option for <span class="samp">%X</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%X</code><dd>Output the accumulated linker options specified by <span class="option">-Wl</span> or a <span class="samp">%x</span>
spec string.

     <br><dt><code>%Y</code><dd>Output the accumulated assembler options specified by <span class="option">-Wa</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%Z</code><dd>Output the accumulated preprocessor options specified by <span class="option">-Wp</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%v1</code><dd>Substitute the major version number of GCC. 
(For version 2.9.5, this is 2.)

     <br><dt><code>%v2</code><dd>Substitute the minor version number of GCC. 
(For version 2.9.5, this is 9.)

     <br><dt><code>%v3</code><dd>Substitute the patch level number of GCC. 
(For version 2.9.5, this is 5.)

     <br><dt><code>%a</code><dd>Process the <code>asm</code> spec.  This is used to compute the
switches to be passed to the assembler.

     <br><dt><code>%A</code><dd>Process the <code>asm_final</code> spec.  This is a spec string for
passing switches to an assembler post-processor, if such a program is
needed.

     <br><dt><code>%l</code><dd>Process the <code>link</code> spec.  This is the spec for computing the
command line passed to the linker.  Typically it will make use of the
<span class="samp">%L %G %S %D and %E</span> sequences.

     <br><dt><code>%D</code><dd>Dump out a <span class="option">-L</span> option for each directory that GCC believes might
contain startup files.  If the target supports multilibs then the
current multilib directory will be prepended to each of these paths.

     <br><dt><code>%M</code><dd>Output the multilib directory with directory separators replaced with
<span class="samp">_</span>.  If multilib directories are not set, or the multilib directory is
<span class="file">.</span> then this option emits nothing.

     <br><dt><code>%L</code><dd>Process the <code>lib</code> spec.  This is a spec string for deciding which
libraries should be included on the command line to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>%G</code><dd>Process the <code>libgcc</code> spec.  This is a spec string for deciding
which GCC support library should be included on the command line to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>%S</code><dd>Process the <code>startfile</code> spec.  This is a spec for deciding which
object files should be the first ones passed to the linker.  Typically
this might be a file named <span class="file">crt0.o</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%E</code><dd>Process the <code>endfile</code> spec.  This is a spec string that specifies
the last object files that will be passed to the linker.

     <br><dt><code>%C</code><dd>Process the <code>cpp</code> spec.  This is used to construct the arguments
to be passed to the C preprocessor.

     <br><dt><code>%c</code><dd>Process the <code>signed_char</code> spec.  This is intended to be used
to tell cpp whether a char is signed.  It typically has the definition:
     <pre class="smallexample">          %{funsigned-char:-D__CHAR_UNSIGNED__}
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>%1</code><dd>Process the <code>cc1</code> spec.  This is used to construct the options to be
passed to the actual C compiler (<span class="samp">cc1</span>).

     <br><dt><code>%2</code><dd>Process the <code>cc1plus</code> spec.  This is used to construct the options to be
passed to the actual C++ compiler (<span class="samp">cc1plus</span>).

     <br><dt><code>%*</code><dd>Substitute the variable part of a matched option.  See below. 
Note that each comma in the substituted string is replaced by
a single space.

     <br><dt><code>%:</code><var>function</var><code>(</code><var>args</var><code>)</code><dd>Call the named function <var>function</var>, passing it <var>args</var>. 
<var>args</var> is first processed as a nested spec string, then split
into an argument vector in the usual fashion.  The function returns
a string which is processed as if it had appeared literally as part
of the current spec.

     <p>The following built-in spec functions are provided:

          <dl>
<dt><code>if-exists</code><dd>The <code>if-exists</code> spec function takes one argument, an absolute
pathname to a file.  If the file exists, <code>if-exists</code> returns the
pathname.  Here is a small example of its usage:

          <pre class="smallexample">               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) crtbegin%O%s
          </pre>
          <br><dt><code>if-exists-else</code><dd>The <code>if-exists-else</code> spec function is similar to the <code>if-exists</code>
spec function, except that it takes two arguments.  The first argument is
an absolute pathname to a file.  If the file exists, <code>if-exists-else</code>
returns the pathname.  If it does not exist, it returns the second argument. 
This way, <code>if-exists-else</code> can be used to select one file or another,
based on the existence of the first.  Here is a small example of its usage:

          <pre class="smallexample">               *startfile:
               crt0%O%s %:if-exists(crti%O%s) \
               %:if-exists-else(crtbeginT%O%s crtbegin%O%s)
          </pre>
          </dl>

     <br><dt><code>%{S}</code><dd>Substitutes the <code>-S</code> switch, if that switch was given to GCC. 
If that switch was not specified, this substitutes nothing.  Note that
the leading dash is omitted when specifying this option, and it is
automatically inserted if the substitution is performed.  Thus the spec
string <span class="samp">%{foo}</span> would match the command-line option <span class="option">-foo</span>
and would output the command line option <span class="option">-foo</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%W{S}</code><dd>Like %{<code>S</code>} but mark last argument supplied within as a file to be
deleted on failure.

     <br><dt><code>%{S*}</code><dd>Substitutes all the switches specified to GCC whose names start
with <code>-S</code>, but which also take an argument.  This is used for
switches like <span class="option">-o</span>, <span class="option">-D</span>, <span class="option">-I</span>, etc. 
GCC considers <span class="option">-o foo</span> as being
one switch whose names starts with <span class="samp">o</span>.  %{o*} would substitute this
text, including the space.  Thus two arguments would be generated.

     <br><dt><code>%{^S*}</code><dd>Like %{<code>S</code>*}, but don't put a blank between a switch and its
argument.  Thus %{^o*} would only generate one argument, not two.

     <br><dt><code>%{S*&amp;T*}</code><dd>Like %{<code>S</code>*}, but preserve order of <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> options
(the order of <code>S</code> and <code>T</code> in the spec is not significant). 
There can be any number of ampersand-separated variables; for each the
wild card is optional.  Useful for CPP as <span class="samp">%{D*&amp;U*&amp;A*}</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%{&lt;S}</code><dd>Remove all occurrences of <code>-S</code> from the command line.  Note&mdash;this
command is position dependent.  <span class="samp">%</span> commands in the spec string
before this option will see <code>-S</code>, <span class="samp">%</span> commands in the spec
string after this option will not.

     <br><dt><code>%{S*:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code> if one or more switches whose names start with
<code>-S</code> are specified to GCC.  Note that the tail part of the
<code>-S</code> option (i.e. the part matched by the <span class="samp">*</span>) will be substituted
for each occurrence of <span class="samp">%*</span> within <code>X</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, but only if the <span class="samp">-S</span> switch was given to GCC.

     <br><dt><code>%{!S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, but only if the <span class="samp">-S</span> switch was <em>not</em> given to GCC.

     <br><dt><code>%{|S:X}</code><dd>Like %{<code>S</code>:<code>X</code>}, but if no <code>S</code> switch, substitute <span class="samp">-</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%{|!S:X}</code><dd>Like %{!<code>S</code>:<code>X</code>}, but if there is an <code>S</code> switch, substitute <span class="samp">-</span>.

     <br><dt><code>%{.S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, but only if processing a file with suffix <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{!.S:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code>, but only if <em>not</em> processing a file with suffix <code>S</code>.

     <br><dt><code>%{S|P:X}</code><dd>Substitutes <code>X</code> if either <code>-S</code> or <code>-P</code> was given to GCC.  This may be
combined with <span class="samp">!</span> and <span class="samp">.</span> sequences as well, although they
have a stronger binding than the <span class="samp">|</span>.  For example a spec string
like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          %{.c:-foo} %{!.c:-bar} %{.c|d:-baz} %{!.c|d:-boggle}
     </pre>
     <p>will output the following command-line options from the following input
command-line options:

     <pre class="smallexample">          fred.c        -foo -baz
          jim.d         -bar -boggle
          -d fred.c     -foo -baz -boggle
          -d jim.d      -bar -baz -boggle
     </pre>
     </dl>

   <p>The conditional text <code>X</code> in a %{<code>S</code>:<code>X</code>} or
%{!<code>S</code>:<code>X</code>} construct may contain other nested <span class="samp">%</span> constructs
or spaces, or even newlines.  They are processed as usual, as described
above.

   <p>The <span class="option">-O</span>, <span class="option">-f</span>, <span class="option">-m</span>, and <span class="option">-W</span>
switches are handled specifically in these
constructs.  If another value of <span class="option">-O</span> or the negated form of a <span class="option">-f</span>, <span class="option">-m</span>, or
<span class="option">-W</span> switch is found later in the command line, the earlier switch
value is ignored, except with {<code>S</code>*} where <code>S</code> is just one
letter, which passes all matching options.

   <p>The character <span class="samp">|</span> at the beginning of the predicate text is used to indicate
that a command should be piped to the following command, but only if <span class="option">-pipe</span>
is specified.

   <p>It is built into GCC which switches take arguments and which do not. 
(You might think it would be useful to generalize this to allow each
compiler's spec to say which switches take arguments.  But this cannot
be done in a consistent fashion.  GCC cannot even decide which input
files have been specified without knowing which switches take arguments,
and it must know which input files to compile in order to tell which
compilers to run).

   <p>GCC also knows implicitly that arguments starting in <span class="option">-l</span> are to be
treated as compiler output files, and passed to the linker in their
proper position among the other output files.

<h3 class="section">3.16 Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version</h3>

<p><a name="index-target-options-535"></a><a name="index-cross-compiling-536"></a><a name="index-specifying-machine-version-537"></a><a name="index-specifying-compiler-version-and-target-machine-538"></a><a name="index-compiler-version_002c-specifying-539"></a><a name="index-target-machine_002c-specifying-540"></a>
The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called <span class="file">gcc</span>, or
<span class="file">&lt;machine&gt;-gcc</span> when cross-compiling, or
<span class="file">&lt;machine&gt;-gcc-&lt;version&gt;</span> to run a version other than the one that
was installed last.  Sometimes this is inconvenient, so GCC provides
options that will switch to another cross-compiler or version.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-b </code><var>machine</var><dd><a name="index-b-541"></a>The argument <var>machine</var> specifies the target machine for compilation.

     <p>The value to use for <var>machine</var> is the same as was specified as the
machine type when configuring GCC as a cross-compiler.  For
example, if a cross-compiler was configured with <span class="samp">configure
i386v</span>, meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you
would specify <span class="option">-b i386v</span> to run that cross compiler.

     <br><dt><code>-V </code><var>version</var><dd><a name="index-V-542"></a>The argument <var>version</var> specifies which version of GCC to run. 
This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
<var>version</var> might be <span class="samp">2.0</span>, meaning to run GCC version 2.0. 
</dl>

   <p>The <span class="option">-V</span> and <span class="option">-b</span> options work by running the
<span class="file">&lt;machine&gt;-gcc-&lt;version&gt;</span> executable, so there's no real reason to
use them if you can just run that directly.

Earlier we discussed the standard option <span class="option">-b</span> which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target
machines, such as VAX vs. 68000 vs. 80386.

   <p>In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with <span class="samp">-m</span>, to choose among various
hardware models or configurations&mdash;for example, 68010 vs 68020,
floating coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the
compiler can compile for any model or configuration, according to the
options specified.

   <p>Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.

   <p>These options are defined by the macro <code>TARGET_SWITCHES</code> in the
machine description.  The default for the options is also defined by
that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.

<h4 class="subsection">3.17.1 M680x0 Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-M680x0-options-547"></a>
These are the <span class="samp">-m</span> options defined for the 68000 series.  The default
values for these options depends on which style of 68000 was selected when
the compiler was configured; the defaults for the most common choices are
given below.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-m68000</code><dt><code>-mc68000</code><dd><a name="index-m68000-548"></a><a name="index-mc68000-549"></a>Generate output for a 68000.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68000-based systems.

     <p>Use this option for microcontrollers with a 68000 or EC000 core,
including the 68008, 68302, 68306, 68307, 68322, 68328 and 68356.

     <br><dt><code>-m68020</code><dt><code>-mc68020</code><dd><a name="index-m68020-550"></a><a name="index-mc68020-551"></a>Generate output for a 68020.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for 68020-based systems.

     <br><dt><code>-m68881</code><dd><a name="index-m68881-552"></a>Generate output containing 68881 instructions for floating point. 
This is the default for most 68020 systems unless <span class="option">--nfp</span> was
specified when the compiler was configured.

     <br><dt><code>-m68030</code><dd><a name="index-m68030-553"></a>Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default when the compiler is
configured for 68030-based systems.

     <br><dt><code>-m68040</code><dd><a name="index-m68040-554"></a>Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the compiler is
configured for 68040-based systems.

     <p>This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions that have to be
emulated by software on the 68040.  Use this option if your 68040 does not
have code to emulate those instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-m68060</code><dd><a name="index-m68060-555"></a>Generate output for a 68060.  This is the default when the compiler is
configured for 68060-based systems.

     <p>This option inhibits the use of 68020 and 68881/68882 instructions that
have to be emulated by software on the 68060.  Use this option if your 68060
does not have code to emulate those instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu32</code><dd><a name="index-mcpu32-556"></a>Generate output for a CPU32.  This is the default
when the compiler is configured for CPU32-based systems.

     <p>Use this option for microcontrollers with a
CPU32 or CPU32+ core, including the 68330, 68331, 68332, 68333, 68334,
68336, 68340, 68341, 68349 and 68360.

     <br><dt><code>-m5200</code><dd><a name="index-m5200-557"></a>Generate output for a 520X &ldquo;coldfire&rdquo; family cpu.  This is the default

saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
the arguments there.

     <p>This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.

     <p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <code>printf</code>);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.

     <p>In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)

     <p>The <code>rtd</code> instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030,

<h4 class="subsection">3.17.4 SPARC Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-SPARC-options-589"></a>
These <span class="samp">-m</span> switches are supported on the SPARC:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mno-app-regs</code><dt><code>-mapp-regs</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dapp_002dregs-590"></a><a name="index-mapp_002dregs-591"></a>Specify <span class="option">-mapp-regs</span> to generate output using the global registers
2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.  This
is the default.

     <p>To be fully SVR4 ABI compliant at the cost of some performance loss,
specify <span class="option">-mno-app-regs</span>.  You should compile libraries and system
software with this option.

     <br><dt><code>-mfpu</code><dt><code>-mhard-float</code><dd><a name="index-mfpu-592"></a><a name="index-mhard_002dfloat-593"></a>Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the
default.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-fpu</code><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dfpu-594"></a><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-595"></a>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded targets <span class="samp">sparc-*-aout</span> and
<span class="samp">sparclite-*-*</span> do provide software floating point support.

     <p><span class="option">-msoft-float</span> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <span class="file">libgcc.a</span>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <span class="option">-msoft-float</span> in order for
this to work.

     <br><dt><code>-mhard-quad-float</code><dd><a name="index-mhard_002dquad_002dfloat-596"></a>Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating point
instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-msoft-quad-float</code><dd><a name="index-msoft_002dquad_002dfloat-597"></a>Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

     <p>As of this writing, there are no sparc implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the
<span class="option">-msoft-quad-float</span> option is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-flat</code><dt><code>-mflat</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dflat-598"></a><a name="index-mflat-599"></a>With <span class="option">-mflat</span>, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and will use a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; or single register window calling convention. 
This model uses %i7 as the frame pointer and is compatible with the normal
register window model.  Code from either may be intermixed. 
The local registers and the input registers (0&ndash;5) are still treated as
&ldquo;call saved&rdquo; registers and will be saved on the stack as necessary.

     <p>With <span class="option">-mno-flat</span> (the default), the compiler emits save/restore
instructions (except for leaf functions) and is the normal mode of operation.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-unaligned-doubles</code><dt><code>-munaligned-doubles</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dunaligned_002ddoubles-600"></a><a name="index-munaligned_002ddoubles-601"></a>Assume that doubles have 8 byte alignment.  This is the default.

     <p>With <span class="option">-munaligned-doubles</span>, GCC assumes that doubles have 8 byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4 byte alignment. 
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating point code.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-faster-structs</code><dt><code>-mfaster-structs</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dfaster_002dstructs-602"></a><a name="index-mfaster_002dstructs-603"></a>With <span class="option">-mfaster-structs</span>, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8 byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
<code>ldd</code> and <code>std</code> instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many <code>ld</code> and <code>st</code> pairs. 
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the SPARC
ABI.  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code will not be directly in line with
the rules of the ABI.

     <br><dt><code>-mimpure-text</code><dd><a name="index-mimpure_002dtext-604"></a><span class="option">-mimpure-text</span>, used in addition to <span class="option">-shared</span>, tells
the compiler to not pass <span class="option">-z text</span> to the linker when linking a
shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-dependent
code into a shared object.

     <p><span class="option">-mimpure-text</span> suppresses the &ldquo;relocations remain against
allocatable but non-writable sections&rdquo; linker error message. 
However, the necessary relocations will trigger copy-on-write, and the
shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of
using <span class="option">-mimpure-text</span>, you should compile all source code with
<span class="option">-fpic</span> or <span class="option">-fPIC</span>.

     <p>This option is only available on SunOS and Solaris.

     <br><dt><code>-mv8</code><dt><code>-msparclite</code><dd><a name="index-mv8-605"></a><a name="index-msparclite-606"></a>These two options select variations on the SPARC architecture.

     <p>By default (unless specifically configured for the Fujitsu SPARClite),
GCC generates code for the v7 variant of the SPARC architecture.

     <p><span class="option">-mv8</span> will give you SPARC v8 code.  The only difference from v7
code is that the compiler emits the integer multiply and integer
divide instructions which exist in SPARC v8 but not in SPARC v7.

     <p><span class="option">-msparclite</span> will give you SPARClite code.  This adds the integer
multiply, integer divide step and scan (<code>ffs</code>) instructions which
exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC v7.

     <p>These options are deprecated and will be deleted in a future GCC release. 
They have been replaced with <span class="option">-mcpu=xxx</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mcypress</code><dt><code>-msupersparc</code><dd><a name="index-mcypress-607"></a><a name="index-msupersparc-608"></a>These two options select the processor for which the code is optimized.

     <p>With <span class="option">-mcypress</span> (the default), the compiler optimizes code for the
Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the SPARCStation/SPARCServer 3xx series. 
This is also appropriate for the older SPARCStation 1, 2, IPX etc.

     <p>With <span class="option">-msupersparc</span> the compiler optimizes code for the SuperSPARC cpu, as
used in the SPARCStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series.  This flag also enables use
of the full SPARC v8 instruction set.

     <p>These options are deprecated and will be deleted in a future GCC release. 
They have been replaced with <span class="option">-mcpu=xxx</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-609"></a>Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling parameters

and conforming to the function calling standards for the APCS 26-bit
option.  This option replaces the <span class="option">-m2</span> and <span class="option">-m3</span> options
of previous releases of the compiler.

     <br><dt><code>-mapcs-32</code><dd><a name="index-mapcs_002d32-629"></a>Generate code for a processor running with a 32-bit program counter,
and conforming to the function calling standards for the APCS 32-bit
option.  This option replaces the <span class="option">-m6</span> option of previous releases
of the compiler.

     <br><dt><code>-mthumb-interwork</code><dd><a name="index-mthumb_002dinterwork-630"></a>Generate code which supports calling between the ARM and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option the two instruction sets cannot
be reliably used inside one program.  The default is
<span class="option">-mno-thumb-interwork</span>, since slightly larger code is generated
when <span class="option">-mthumb-interwork</span> is specified.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-sched-prolog</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dsched_002dprolog-631"></a>Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prolog, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions will start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start if functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is <span class="option">-msched-prolog</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mhard-float</code><dd><a name="index-mhard_002dfloat-632"></a>Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the
default.

     <br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-633"></a>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all ARM
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

     <p><span class="option">-msoft-float</span> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <span class="file">libgcc.a</span>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <span class="option">-msoft-float</span> in order for
this to work.

     <br><dt><code>-mlittle-endian</code><dd><a name="index-mlittle_002dendian-634"></a>Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.

     <br><dt><code>-mbig-endian</code><dd><a name="index-mbig_002dendian-635"></a>Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.

     <br><dt><code>-mwords-little-endian</code><dd><a name="index-mwords_002dlittle_002dendian-636"></a>This option only applies when generating code for big-endian processors. 
Generate code for a little-endian word order but a big-endian byte
order.  That is, a byte order of the form <span class="samp">32107654</span>.  Note: this
option should only be used if you require compatibility with code for
big-endian ARM processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to
2.8.

     <br><dt><code>-malignment-traps</code><dd><a name="index-malignment_002dtraps-637"></a>Generate code that will not trap if the MMU has alignment traps enabled. 
On ARM architectures prior to ARMv4, there were no instructions to
access half-word objects stored in memory.  However, when reading from
memory a feature of the ARM architecture allows a word load to be used,
even if the address is unaligned, and the processor core will rotate the
data as it is being loaded.  This option tells the compiler that such
misaligned accesses will cause a MMU trap and that it should instead
synthesize the access as a series of byte accesses.  The compiler can
still use word accesses to load half-word data if it knows that the
address is aligned to a word boundary.

     <p>This option is ignored when compiling for ARM architecture 4 or later,
since these processors have instructions to directly access half-word
objects in memory.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-alignment-traps</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dalignment_002dtraps-638"></a>Generate code that assumes that the MMU will not trap unaligned
accesses.  This produces better code when the target instruction set
does not have half-word memory operations (i.e. implementations prior to
ARMv4).

     <p>Note that you cannot use this option to access unaligned word objects,
since the processor will only fetch one 32-bit aligned object from
memory.

     <p>The default setting for most targets is <span class="option">-mno-alignment-traps</span>, since
this produces better code when there are no half-word memory
instructions available.

     <br><dt><code>-mshort-load-bytes</code><dt><code>-mno-short-load-words</code><dd><a name="index-mshort_002dload_002dbytes-639"></a><a name="index-mno_002dshort_002dload_002dwords-640"></a>These are deprecated aliases for <span class="option">-malignment-traps</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-643"></a>This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses this name
to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating

<span class="samp">arm3</span>, <span class="samp">arm6</span>, <span class="samp">arm60</span>, <span class="samp">arm600</span>, <span class="samp">arm610</span>,

<span class="samp">arm1020t</span>, <span class="samp">xscale</span>.

     <dt><code>-mtune=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mtune-644"></a>This option is very similar to the <span class="option">-mcpu=</span> option, except that
instead of specifying the actual target processor type, and hence
restricting which instructions can be used, it specifies that GCC should
tune the performance of the code as if the target were of the type
specified in this option, but still choosing the instructions that it
will generate based on the cpu specified by a <span class="option">-mcpu=</span> option. 
For some ARM implementations better performance can be obtained by using
this option.

     <br><dt><code>-march=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-march-645"></a>This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the <span class="option">-mcpu=</span> option.  Permissible names are: <span class="samp">armv2</span>,
<span class="samp">armv2a</span>, <span class="samp">armv3</span>, <span class="samp">armv3m</span>, <span class="samp">armv4</span>, <span class="samp">armv4t</span>,

the target.  Permissible values are 2 and 3.  <span class="option">-mfp=</span> is a synonym
for <span class="option">-mfpe=</span>, for compatibility with older versions of GCC.

     <br><dt><code>-mstructure-size-boundary=</code><var>n</var><dd><a name="index-mstructure_002dsize_002dboundary-648"></a>The size of all structures and unions will be rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8 and
32.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the COFF
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  Specifying the larger number
can produce faster, more efficient code, but can also increase the size
of the program.  The two values are potentially incompatible.  Code
compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to work with code or
libraries compiled with the other value, if they exchange information
using structures or unions.

     <br><dt><code>-mabort-on-noreturn</code><dd><a name="index-mabort_002don_002dnoreturn-649"></a>Generate a call to the function <code>abort</code> at the end of a
<code>noreturn</code> function.  It will be executed if the function tries to
return.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-calls</code><dt><code>-mno-long-calls</code><dd><a name="index-mlong_002dcalls-650"></a><a name="index-mno_002dlong_002dcalls-651"></a>Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
will lie outside of the 64 megabyte addressing range of the offset based
version of subroutine call instruction.

     <p>Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls will be turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
which have the <span class="samp">short-call</span> attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a <span class="samp">#pragma no_long_calls</span> directive and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit, will not be turned into long calls.  The exception to this rule is
that weak function definitions, functions with the <span class="samp">long-call</span>
attribute or the <span class="samp">section</span> attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a <span class="samp">#pragma long_calls</span> directive, will always be
turned into long calls.

     <p>This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
<span class="option">-mno-long-calls</span> will restore the default behavior, as will
placing the function calls within the scope of a <span class="samp">#pragma
long_calls_off</span> directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.

     <br><dt><code>-mnop-fun-dllimport</code><dd><a name="index-mnop_002dfun_002ddllimport-652"></a>Disable support for the <code>dllimport</code> attribute.

     <br><dt><code>-msingle-pic-base</code><dd><a name="index-msingle_002dpic_002dbase-653"></a>Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The run-time system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.

     <br><dt><code>-mpic-register=</code><var>reg</var><dd><a name="index-mpic_002dregister-654"></a>Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing.  The default is R10
unless stack-checking is enabled, when R9 is used.

     <br><dt><code>-mpoke-function-name</code><dd><a name="index-mpoke_002dfunction_002dname-655"></a>Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:

     <pre class="smallexample">               t0
                   .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
                   .align
               t1
                   .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
               arm_poke_function_name
                   mov     ip, sp

                   sub     fp, ip, #4
     </pre>
     <p>When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
<code>pc</code> stored at <code>fp + 0</code>.  If the trace function then looks at
location <code>pc - 12</code> and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length <code>((pc[-3]) &amp; 0xff000000)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-mthumb</code><dd><a name="index-mthumb-656"></a>Generate code for the 16-bit Thumb instruction set.  The default is to
use the 32-bit ARM instruction set.

     <br><dt><code>-mtpcs-frame</code><dd><a name="index-mtpcs_002dframe-657"></a>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all non-leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does
not call any other functions.)  The default is <span class="option">-mno-tpcs-frame</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mtpcs-leaf-frame</code><dd><a name="index-mtpcs_002dleaf_002dframe-658"></a>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
Standard for all leaf functions.  (A leaf function is one that does

     <br><dt><code>-mcallee-super-interworking</code><dd><a name="index-mcallee_002dsuper_002dinterworking-659"></a>Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an ARM
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be called from
non-interworking code.

     <br><dt><code>-mcaller-super-interworking</code><dd><a name="index-mcaller_002dsuper_002dinterworking-660"></a>Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.

of volatile memory references.  By default, consistency is
guaranteed.

     <p>The order of memory references made by the MC88110 processor does
not always match the order of the instructions requesting those
references.  In particular, a load instruction may execute before
a preceding store instruction.  Such reordering violates
sequential consistency of volatile memory references, when there
are multiple processors.   When consistency must be guaranteed,
GCC generates special instructions, as needed, to force
execution in the proper order.

     <p>The MC88100 processor does not reorder memory references and so
always provides sequential consistency.  However, by default, GCC
generates the special instructions to guarantee consistency
even when you use <span class="option">-m88100</span>, so that the code may be run on an
MC88110 processor.  If you intend to run your code only on the
MC88100 processor, you may use <span class="option">-mno-serialize-volatile</span>.

     <p>Some models of the MC88100 processor fail to trap upon integer
division by zero under certain conditions.  By default, when
compiling code that might be run on such a processor, GCC
generates code that explicitly checks for zero-valued divisors
and traps with exception number 503 when one is detected.  Use of
<span class="option">-mno-check-zero-division</span> suppresses such checking for code
generated to run on an MC88100 processor.

     <p>GCC assumes that the MC88110 processor correctly detects all instances
of integer division by zero.  When <span class="option">-m88110</span> is specified, no
explicit checks for zero-valued divisors are generated, and both
<span class="option">-mcheck-zero-division</span> and <span class="option">-mno-check-zero-division</span> are

MC88100 processor.  By default, the div instruction is not used.

     <p>On the MC88100 processor the signed integer division instruction
div) traps to the operating system on a negative operand.  The
operating system transparently completes the operation, but at a
large cost in execution time.  By default, when compiling code
that might be run on an MC88100 processor, GCC emulates signed
integer division using the unsigned integer division instruction
divu), thereby avoiding the large penalty of a trap to the
operating system.  Such emulation has its own, smaller, execution
cost in both time and space.  To the extent that your code's
important signed integer division operations are performed on two
nonnegative operands, it may be desirable to use the div
instruction directly.

     <p>On the MC88110 processor the div instruction (also known as the
divs instruction) processes negative operands without trapping to
the operating system.  When <span class="option">-m88110</span> is specified,
<span class="option">-muse-div-instruction</span> is ignored, and the div instruction is used
for signed integer division.

     <p>Note that the result of dividing <code>INT_MIN</code> by &minus;1 is undefined.  In
particular, the behavior of such a division with and without
<span class="option">-muse-div-instruction</span> may differ.

<p><a name="index-RS_002f6000-and-PowerPC-Options-723"></a><a name="index-IBM-RS_002f6000-and-PowerPC-Options-724"></a>
These <span class="samp">-m</span> options are defined for the IBM RS/6000 and PowerPC:
     <dl>
<dt><code>-mpower</code><dt><code>-mno-power</code><dt><code>-mpower2</code><dt><code>-mno-power2</code><dt><code>-mpowerpc</code><dt><code>-mno-powerpc</code><dt><code>-mpowerpc-gpopt</code><dt><code>-mno-powerpc-gpopt</code><dt><code>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</code><dt><code>-mno-powerpc-gfxopt</code><dt><code>-mpowerpc64</code><dt><code>-mno-powerpc64</code><dd><a name="index-mpower-725"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpower-726"></a><a name="index-mpower2-727"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpower2-728"></a><a name="index-mpowerpc-729"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpowerpc-730"></a><a name="index-mpowerpc_002dgpopt-731"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpowerpc_002dgpopt-732"></a><a name="index-mpowerpc_002dgfxopt-733"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpowerpc_002dgfxopt-734"></a><a name="index-mpowerpc64-735"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpowerpc64-736"></a>GCC supports two related instruction set architectures for the
RS/6000 and PowerPC.  The <dfn>POWER</dfn> instruction set are those
instructions supported by the <span class="samp">rios</span> chip set used in the original
RS/6000 systems and the <dfn>PowerPC</dfn> instruction set is the
architecture of the Motorola MPC5xx, MPC6xx, MPC8xx microprocessors, and
the IBM 4xx microprocessors.

     <p>Neither architecture is a subset of the other.  However there is a
large common subset of instructions supported by both.  An MQ
register is included in processors supporting the POWER architecture.

     <p>You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring GCC.  Specifying the
<span class="option">-mcpu=</span><var>cpu_type</var> overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the <span class="option">-mcpu=</span><var>cpu_type</var> option
rather than the options listed above.

     <p>The <span class="option">-mpower</span> option allows GCC to generate instructions that
are found only in the POWER architecture and to use the MQ register. 
Specifying <span class="option">-mpower2</span> implies <span class="option">-power</span> and also allows GCC
to generate instructions that are present in the POWER2 architecture but
not the original POWER architecture.

     <p>The <span class="option">-mpowerpc</span> option allows GCC to generate instructions that
are found only in the 32-bit subset of the PowerPC architecture. 
Specifying <span class="option">-mpowerpc-gpopt</span> implies <span class="option">-mpowerpc</span> and also allows
GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
<span class="option">-mpowerpc-gfxopt</span> implies <span class="option">-mpowerpc</span> and also allows GCC to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select.

     <p>The <span class="option">-mpowerpc64</span> option allows GCC to generate the additional
64-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64 architecture
and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities.  GCC defaults to
<span class="option">-mno-powerpc64</span>.

     <p>If you specify both <span class="option">-mno-power</span> and <span class="option">-mno-powerpc</span>, GCC
will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures plus some special AIX common-mode calls, and will not use
the MQ register.  Specifying both <span class="option">-mpower</span> and <span class="option">-mpowerpc</span>
permits GCC to use any instruction from either architecture and to
allow use of the MQ register; specify this for the Motorola MPC601.

     <br><dt><code>-mnew-mnemonics</code><dt><code>-mold-mnemonics</code><dd><a name="index-mnew_002dmnemonics-737"></a><a name="index-mold_002dmnemonics-738"></a>Select which mnemonics to use in the generated assembler code.  With
<span class="option">-mnew-mnemonics</span>, GCC uses the assembler mnemonics defined for
the PowerPC architecture.  With <span class="option">-mold-mnemonics</span> it uses the
assembler mnemonics defined for the POWER architecture.  Instructions
defined in only one architecture have only one mnemonic; GCC uses that
mnemonic irrespective of which of these options is specified.

     <p>GCC defaults to the mnemonics appropriate for the architecture in
use.  Specifying <span class="option">-mcpu=</span><var>cpu_type</var> sometimes overrides the
value of these option.  Unless you are building a cross-compiler, you
should normally not specify either <span class="option">-mnew-mnemonics</span> or
<span class="option">-mold-mnemonics</span>, but should instead accept the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-739"></a>Set architecture type, register usage, choice of mnemonics, and

     <p><span class="option">-mcpu=common</span> selects a completely generic processor.  Code
generated under this option will run on any POWER or PowerPC processor. 
GCC will use only the instructions in the common subset of both
architectures, and will not use the MQ register.  GCC assumes a generic
processor model for scheduling purposes.

     <p><span class="option">-mcpu=power</span>, <span class="option">-mcpu=power2</span>, <span class="option">-mcpu=powerpc</span>, and
<span class="option">-mcpu=powerpc64</span> specify generic POWER, POWER2, pure 32-bit
PowerPC (i.e., not MPC601), and 64-bit PowerPC architecture machine
types, with an appropriate, generic processor model assumed for
scheduling purposes.

     <p>The other options specify a specific processor.  Code generated under
those options will run best on that processor, and may not run at all on
others.

     <p>The <span class="option">-mcpu</span> options automatically enable or disable other

every executable file.  The <span class="option">-mfull-toc</span> option is selected by
default.  In that case, GCC will allocate at least one TOC entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  GCC
will also place floating-point constants in the TOC.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the TOC.

     <p>If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount of TOC space used
with the <span class="option">-mno-fp-in-toc</span> and <span class="option">-mno-sum-in-toc</span> options. 
<span class="option">-mno-fp-in-toc</span> prevents GCC from putting floating-point
constants in the TOC and <span class="option">-mno-sum-in-toc</span> forces GCC to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run-time instead of putting that sum into the TOC.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes GCC to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC space.

     <p>If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you specify both of
these options, specify <span class="option">-mminimal-toc</span> instead.  This option causes
GCC to make only one TOC entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, GCC will produce code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little TOC space.  You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently executed code.

<span class="option">-mpowerpc</span>, while <span class="option">-maix32</span> disables the 64-bit ABI and

register save area (RSA) on the stack in addition to argument FPRs.  The
AIX calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  AIX XL
compilers access floating point arguments which do not fit in the
RSA from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the
stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by
default and only is necessary when calling subroutines compiled by AIX
XL compilers without optimization.

<span class="samp">r4400</span>, <span class="samp">r4600</span>, <span class="samp">r4650</span>, <span class="samp">vr5000</span>, <span class="samp">r6000</span>,
<span class="samp">r8000</span>, <span class="samp">4kc</span>, <span class="samp">4kp</span>, <span class="samp">5kc</span>, <span class="samp">20kc</span>,
<span class="samp">orion</span>, and <span class="samp">sb1</span>.  The special value <span class="samp">from-abi</span> selects the
most compatible architecture for the selected ABI (that is,
<span class="samp">mips1</span> for 32-bit ABIs and <span class="samp">mips3</span> for 64-bit ABIs).

     <p>In processor names, a final <span class="samp">000</span> can be abbreviated as <span class="samp">k</span>
(for example, <span class="samp">-march=r2k</span>).  Prefixes are optional, and
<span class="samp">vr</span> may be written <span class="samp">r</span>.

     <p>GCC defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is <span class="samp">_MIPS_ARCH</span>, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form <span class="samp">_MIPS_ARCH_</span><var>foo</var>,
where <var>foo</var> is the capitalized value of <span class="samp">_MIPS_ARCH</span>. 
For example, <span class="samp">-march=r2000</span> will set <span class="samp">_MIPS_ARCH</span>
to <span class="samp">"r2000"</span> and define the macro <span class="samp">_MIPS_ARCH_R2000</span>.

     <p>Note that the <span class="samp">_MIPS_ARCH</span> macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it will have the full prefix and will not
abbreviate <span class="samp">000</span> as <span class="samp">k</span>.  In the case of <span class="samp">from-abi</span>,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either <span class="samp">"mips1"</span> or
<span class="samp">"mips3"</span>).  It names the default architecture when no
<span class="option">-march</span> option is given.

     <br><dt><code>-mtune=</code><var>arch</var><dd><a name="index-mtune-891"></a>Optimize for <var>arch</var>.  Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of arithmetic
operations.  The list of <var>arch</var> values is the same as for
<span class="option">-march</span>.

     <p>When this option is not used, GCC will optimize for the processor
specified by <span class="option">-march</span>.  By using <span class="option">-march</span> and
<span class="option">-mtune</span> together, it is possible to generate code that will
run on a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.

     <p><span class="samp">-mtune</span> defines the macros <span class="samp">_MIPS_TUNE</span> and
<span class="samp">_MIPS_TUNE_</span><var>foo</var>, which work in the same way as the
<span class="samp">-march</span> ones described above.

accumulate instructions, when they are available.  These instructions
are generated by default if they are available, but this may be
undesirable if the extra precision causes problems or on certain chips
in the mode where denormals are rounded to zero where denormals
generated by multiply and accumulate instructions cause exceptions
anyway.

     <br><dt><code>-mfp32</code><dd><a name="index-mfp32-900"></a>Assume that floating point registers are 32 bits wide.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong32</code><dd><a name="index-mlong32-906"></a>Force long, int, and pointer types to be 32 bits wide.

     <p>The default size of ints, longs and pointers depends on the ABI.  All
the supported ABIs use 32-bit ints.  The n64 ABI uses 64-bit longs, as
does the 64-bit Cygnus EABI; the others use 32-bit longs.  Pointers
are the same size as longs, or the same size as integer registers,
whichever is smaller.

     <br><dt><code>-mabi=32</code><dt><code>-mabi=o64</code><dt><code>-mabi=n32</code><dt><code>-mabi=64</code><dt><code>-mabi=eabi</code><dt><code>-mabi=meabi</code><dd><a name="index-mabi_003d32-907"></a><a name="index-mabi_003do64-908"></a><a name="index-mabi_003dn32-909"></a><a name="index-mabi_003d64-910"></a><a name="index-mabi_003deabi-911"></a><a name="index-mabi_003dmeabi-912"></a>Generate code for the given ABI.

     <p>Note that there are two embedded ABIs: <span class="option">-mabi=eabi</span>
selects the one defined by Cygnus while <span class="option">-meabi=meabi</span>
selects the one defined by MIPS.  Both these ABIs have
32-bit and 64-bit variants.  Normally, GCC will generate
64-bit code when you select a 64-bit architecture, but you
can use <span class="option">-mgp32</span> to get 32-bit code instead.

     <br><dt><code>-mmips-as</code><dd><a name="index-mmips_002das-913"></a>Generate code for the MIPS assembler, and invoke <span class="file">mips-tfile</span> to
add normal debug information.  This is the default for all
platforms except for the OSF/1 reference platform, using the OSF/rose
object format.  If the either of the <span class="option">-gstabs</span> or <span class="option">-gstabs+</span>
switches are used, the <span class="file">mips-tfile</span> program will encapsulate the
stabs within MIPS ECOFF.

     <br><dt><code>-mgas</code><dd><a name="index-mgas-914"></a>Generate code for the GNU assembler.  This is the default on the OSF/1
reference platform, using the OSF/rose object format.  Also, this is
the default if the configure option <span class="option">--with-gnu-as</span> is used.

     <br><dt><code>-msplit-addresses</code><dt><code>-mno-split-addresses</code><dd><a name="index-msplit_002daddresses-915"></a><a name="index-mno_002dsplit_002daddresses-916"></a>Generate code to load the high and low parts of address constants separately. 
This allows GCC to optimize away redundant loads of the high order
bits of addresses.  This optimization requires GNU as and GNU ld. 
This optimization is enabled by default for some embedded targets where
GNU as and GNU ld are standard.

     <br><dt><code>-mrnames</code><dt><code>-mno-rnames</code><dd><a name="index-mrnames-917"></a><a name="index-mno_002drnames-918"></a>The <span class="option">-mrnames</span> switch says to output code using the MIPS software
names for the registers, instead of the hardware names (ie, <var>a0</var>
instead of <var>$4</var>).  The only known assembler that supports this option
is the Algorithmics assembler.

     <br><dt><code>-mgpopt</code><dt><code>-mno-gpopt</code><dd><a name="index-mgpopt-919"></a><a name="index-mno_002dgpopt-920"></a>The <span class="option">-mgpopt</span> switch says to write all of the data declarations
before the instructions in the text section, this allows the MIPS
assembler to generate one word memory references instead of using two
words for short global or static data items.  This is on by default if
optimization is selected.

     <br><dt><code>-mstats</code><dt><code>-mno-stats</code><dd><a name="index-mstats-921"></a><a name="index-mno_002dstats-922"></a>For each non-inline function processed, the <span class="option">-mstats</span> switch
causes the compiler to emit one line to the standard error file to
print statistics about the program (number of registers saved, stack
size, etc.).

     <br><dt><code>-mmemcpy</code><dt><code>-mno-memcpy</code><dd><a name="index-mmemcpy-923"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmemcpy-924"></a>The <span class="option">-mmemcpy</span> switch makes all block moves call the appropriate
string function (<span class="samp">memcpy</span> or <span class="samp">bcopy</span>) instead of possibly
generating inline code.

     <br><dt><code>-mmips-tfile</code><dt><code>-mno-mips-tfile</code><dd><a name="index-mmips_002dtfile-925"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmips_002dtfile-926"></a>The <span class="option">-mno-mips-tfile</span> switch causes the compiler not
postprocess the object file with the <span class="file">mips-tfile</span> program,
after the MIPS assembler has generated it to add debug support.  If
<span class="file">mips-tfile</span> is not run, then no local variables will be
available to the debugger.  In addition, <span class="file">stage2</span> and
<span class="file">stage3</span> objects will have the temporary file names passed to the
assembler embedded in the object file, which means the objects will
not compare the same.  The <span class="option">-mno-mips-tfile</span> switch should only
be used when there are bugs in the <span class="file">mips-tfile</span> program that
prevents compilation.

     <br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-927"></a>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not part of GCC. 
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

     <br><dt><code>-mhard-float</code><dd><a name="index-mhard_002dfloat-928"></a>Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is the
default if you use the unmodified sources.

     <br><dt><code>-mabicalls</code><dt><code>-mno-abicalls</code><dd><a name="index-mabicalls-929"></a><a name="index-mno_002dabicalls-930"></a>Emit (or do not emit) the pseudo operations <span class="samp">.abicalls</span>,

loading up a function's address into a register before the call. 
You need to use this switch, if you call outside of the current
512 megabyte segment to functions that are not through pointers.

     <br><dt><code>-mhalf-pic</code><dt><code>-mno-half-pic</code><dd><a name="index-mhalf_002dpic-933"></a><a name="index-mno_002dhalf_002dpic-934"></a>Put pointers to extern references into the data section and load them
up, rather than put the references in the text section.

made using PC relative address, and all data is addressed using the $gp
register.  No more than 65536 bytes of global data may be used.  This
requires GNU as and GNU ld which do most of the work.  This currently
only works on targets which use ECOFF; it does not work with ELF.

     <br><dt><code>-membedded-data</code><dt><code>-mno-embedded-data</code><dd><a name="index-membedded_002ddata-937"></a><a name="index-mno_002dembedded_002ddata-938"></a>Allocate variables to the read-only data section first if possible, then
next in the small data section if possible, otherwise in data.  This gives
slightly slower code than the default, but reduces the amount of RAM required
when executing, and thus may be preferred for some embedded systems.

     <br><dt><code>-muninit-const-in-rodata</code><dt><code>-mno-uninit-const-in-rodata</code><dd><a name="index-muninit_002dconst_002din_002drodata-939"></a><a name="index-mno_002duninit_002dconst_002din_002drodata-940"></a>When used together with <span class="option">-membedded-data</span>, it will always store uninitialized
const variables in the read-only data section.

point coprocessor only supports single precision operations, as on the
<span class="samp">r4650</span> chip.  The <span class="option">-mdouble-float</span> switch permits gcc to use
double precision operations.  This is the default.

     <br><dt><code>-mmad</code><dt><code>-mno-mad</code><dd><a name="index-mmad-943"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmad-944"></a>Permit use of the <span class="samp">mad</span>, <span class="samp">madu</span> and <span class="samp">mul</span> instructions,
as on the <span class="samp">r4650</span> chip.

     <br><dt><code>-m4650</code><dd><a name="index-m4650-945"></a>Turns on <span class="option">-msingle-float</span>, <span class="option">-mmad</span>, and, at least for now,
<span class="option">-mcpu=r4650</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mips16</code><dt><code>-mno-mips16</code><dd><a name="index-mips16-946"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmips16-947"></a>Enable 16-bit instructions.

<span class="option">-mips16</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-EL</code><dd><a name="index-EL-949"></a>Compile code for the processor in little endian mode. 
The requisite libraries are assumed to exist.

     <br><dt><code>-EB</code><dd><a name="index-EB-950"></a>Compile code for the processor in big endian mode. 
The requisite libraries are assumed to exist.

the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
section.  This allows the assembler to emit one word memory reference
instructions based on the global pointer (<var>gp</var> or <var>$28</var>),
instead of the normal two words used.  By default, <var>num</var> is 8 when
the MIPS assembler is used, and 0 when the GNU assembler is used.  The
<span class="option">-G </span><var>num</var> switch is also passed to the assembler and linker. 
All modules should be compiled with the same <span class="option">-G </span><var>num</var>
value.

     <br><dt><code>-nocpp</code><dd><a name="index-nocpp-954"></a>Tell the MIPS assembler to not run its preprocessor over user
assembler files (with a <span class="samp">.s</span> suffix) when assembling them.

     <br><dt><code>-mfix7000</code><dd><a name="index-mfix7000-955"></a>Pass an option to gas which will cause nops to be inserted if
the read of the destination register of an mfhi or mflo instruction
occurs in the following two instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-no-crt0</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dcrt0-956"></a>Do not include the default crt0.

     <br><dt><code>-mflush-func=</code><var>func</var><dt><code>-mno-flush-func</code><dd><a name="index-mflush_002dfunc-957"></a>Specifies the function to call to flush the I and D caches, or to not
call any such function.  If called, the function must take the same
arguments as the common <code>_flush_func()</code>, that is, the address of the
memory range for which the cache is being flushed, the size of the
memory range, and the number 3 (to flush both caches).  The default
depends on the target gcc was configured for, but commonly is either
<span class="samp">_flush_func</span> or <span class="samp">__cpu_flush</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mbranch-likely</code><dt><code>-mno-branch-likely</code><dd><a name="index-mbranch_002dlikely-958"></a><a name="index-mno_002dbranch_002dlikely-959"></a>Enable or disable use of Branch Likely instructions, regardless of the
default for the selected architecture.  By default, Branch Likely
instructions may be generated if they are supported by the selected
architecture.  An exception is for the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures
and processors which implement those architectures; for those, Branch
Likely instructions will not be generated by default because the MIPS32
and MIPS64 architectures specifically deprecate their use.

These <span class="samp">-m</span> options are defined for the i386 and x86-64 family of
computers:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu-type</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-964"></a>Tune to <var>cpu-type</var> everything applicable about the generated code, except

<span class="samp">pentium</span>, <span class="samp">pentium-mmx</span>, <span class="samp">pentiumpro</span>, <span class="samp">pentium2</span>,
<span class="samp">pentium3</span>, <span class="samp">pentium4</span>, <span class="samp">prescott</span>, <span class="samp">nocona</span>,

<span class="samp">athlon</span>, <span class="samp">athlon-tbird</span>, <span class="samp">athlon-4</span>, <span class="samp">athlon-xp</span>,
<span class="samp">athlon-mp</span>, <span class="samp">winchip-c6</span>, <span class="samp">winchip2</span> and <span class="samp">c3</span>.

     <p>While picking a specific <var>cpu-type</var> will schedule things appropriately
for that particular chip, the compiler will not generate any code that
does not run on the i386 without the <span class="option">-march=</span><var>cpu-type</var> option
being used.  <span class="samp">i586</span> is equivalent to <span class="samp">pentium</span> and <span class="samp">i686</span>
is equivalent to <span class="samp">pentiumpro</span>.  <span class="samp">k6</span> and <span class="samp">athlon</span> are the
AMD chips as opposed to the Intel ones.

     <br><dt><code>-march=</code><var>cpu-type</var><dd><a name="index-march-965"></a>Generate instructions for the machine type <var>cpu-type</var>.  The choices
for <var>cpu-type</var> are the same as for <span class="option">-mcpu</span>.  Moreover,
specifying <span class="option">-march=</span><var>cpu-type</var> implies <span class="option">-mcpu=</span><var>cpu-type</var>.

<span class="option">-mcpu=pentium</span>, and <span class="option">-mcpu=pentiumpro</span> respectively. 
These synonyms are deprecated.

     <br><dt><code>-mfpmath=</code><var>unit</var><dd><a name="index-march-970"></a>Generate floating point arithmetics for selected unit <var>unit</var>.  The choices
for <var>unit</var> are:

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">387</span><dd>Use the standard 387 floating point coprocessor present majority of chips and
emulated otherwise.  Code compiled with this option will run almost everywhere. 
The temporary results are computed in 80bit precision instead of precision
specified by the type resulting in slightly different results compared to most
of other chips. See <span class="option">-ffloat-store</span> for more detailed description.

          <p>This is the default choice for i386 compiler.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">sse</span><dd>Use scalar floating point instructions present in the SSE instruction set. 
This instruction set is supported by Pentium3 and newer chips, in the AMD line
by Athlon-4, Athlon-xp and Athlon-mp chips.  The earlier version of SSE
instruction set supports only single precision arithmetics, thus the double and
extended precision arithmetics is still done using 387.  Later version, present
only in Pentium4 and the future AMD x86-64 chips supports double precision
arithmetics too.

          <p>For i387 you need to use <span class="option">-march=</span><var>cpu-type</var>, <span class="option">-msse</span> or
<span class="option">-msse2</span> switches to enable SSE extensions and make this option
effective.  For x86-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled by default.

          <p>The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid
the numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break some existing
code that expects temporaries to be 80bit.

          <p>This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">sse,387</span><dd>Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This effectively double the
amount of available registers and on chips with separate execution units for
387 and SSE the execution resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is
still experimental, because the gcc register allocator does not model separate
functional units well.

cross-compilation.

     <p>On machines where a function returns floating point results in the 80387
register stack, some floating point opcodes may be emitted even if
<span class="option">-msoft-float</span> is used.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dfp_002dret_002din_002d387-975"></a>Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

     <p>The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
<code>float</code> and <code>double</code> in an FPU register, even if there
is no FPU.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate
an FPU.

     <p>The option <span class="option">-mno-fp-ret-in-387</span> causes such values to be returned
in ordinary CPU registers instead.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-fancy-math-387</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dfancy_002dmath_002d387-976"></a>Some 387 emulators do not support the <code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code> and
<code>sqrt</code> instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid
generating those instructions.  This option is the default on FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and NetBSD.  This option is overridden when <span class="option">-march</span>
indicates that the target cpu will always have an FPU and so the
instruction will not need emulation.  As of revision 2.6.1, these
instructions are not generated unless you also use the
<span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span> switch.

     <br><dt><code>-malign-double</code><dt><code>-mno-align-double</code><dd><a name="index-malign_002ddouble-977"></a><a name="index-mno_002dalign_002ddouble-978"></a>Control whether GCC aligns <code>double</code>, <code>long double</code>, and
<code>long long</code> variables on a two word boundary or a one word
boundary.  Aligning <code>double</code> variables on a two word boundary will
produce code that runs somewhat faster on a <span class="samp">Pentium</span> at the
expense of more memory.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you use the <span class="option">-malign-double</span> switch,
structures containing the above types will be aligned differently than
the published application binary interface specifications for the 386
and will not be binary compatible with structures in code compiled
without that switch.

     <br><dt><code>-m96bit-long-double</code><dt><code>-m128bit-long-double</code><dd><a name="index-m96bit_002dlong_002ddouble-979"></a><a name="index-m128bit_002dlong_002ddouble-980"></a>These switches control the size of <code>long double</code> type. The i386
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits,
so <span class="option">-m96bit-long-double</span> is the default in 32 bit mode.

     <p>Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) would prefer <code>long double</code>
to be aligned to an 8 or 16 byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
conforming to the ABI, this would not be possible.  So specifying a
<span class="option">-m128bit-long-double</span> will align <code>long double</code>
to a 16 byte boundary by padding the <code>long double</code> with an additional
32 bit zero.

     <p>In the x86-64 compiler, <span class="option">-m128bit-long-double</span> is the default choice as
its ABI specifies that <code>long double</code> is to be aligned on 16 byte boundary.

     <p>Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87
standard of 80 bits for a <code>long double</code>.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you override the default value for your target ABI, the
structures and arrays containing <code>long double</code> variables will change their size as
well as function calling convention for function taking <code>long double</code>
will be modified.  Hence they will not be binary compatible with arrays or
structures in code compiled without that switch.

     <br><dt><code>-msvr3-shlib</code><dt><code>-mno-svr3-shlib</code><dd><a name="index-msvr3_002dshlib-981"></a><a name="index-mno_002dsvr3_002dshlib-982"></a>Control whether GCC places uninitialized local variables into the
<code>bss</code> or <code>data</code> segments.  <span class="option">-msvr3-shlib</span> places them
into <code>bss</code>.  These options are meaningful only on System V Release 3.

     <br><dt><code>-mrtd</code><dd><a name="index-mrtd-983"></a>Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that
take a fixed number of arguments return with the <code>ret</code> <var>num</var>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This saves one
instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.

     <p>You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling
sequence with the function attribute <span class="samp">stdcall</span>.  You can also
override the <span class="option">-mrtd</span> option by using the function attribute
<span class="samp">cdecl</span>.  See <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> this calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.

     <p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <code>printf</code>);
otherwise incorrect code will be generated for calls to those
functions.

     <p>In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)

     <br><dt><code>-mregparm=</code><var>num</var><dd><a name="index-mregparm-984"></a>Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute <span class="samp">regparm</span>. 
See <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you use this switch, and
<var>num</var> is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the same
value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and
startup modules.

     <br><dt><code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</code><var>num</var><dd><a name="index-mpreferred_002dstack_002dboundary-985"></a>Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to <var>num</var>
byte boundary.  If <span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary</span> is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits), except when optimizing for code
size (<span class="option">-Os</span>), in which case the default is the minimum correct
alignment (4 bytes for x86, and 8 bytes for x86-64).

     <p>On Pentium and PentiumPro, <code>double</code> and <code>long double</code> values
should be aligned to an 8 byte boundary (see <span class="option">-malign-double</span>) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium III, the
Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type <code>__m128</code> suffers similar
penalties if it is not 16 byte aligned.

     <p>To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack. 
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary will most likely misalign the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.

     <p>This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to <span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</span>.

and usually equally fast as method using SUB/MOV operations and is enabled
by default.  In some cases disabling it may improve performance because of
improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.

     <br><dt><code>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</code><dd><a name="index-maccumulate_002doutgoing_002dargs-994"></a>If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments will be
computed in the function prologue.  This is faster on most modern CPUs
because of reduced dependencies, improved scheduling and reduced stack usage
when preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is a notable
increase in code size.  This switch implies <span class="option">-mno-push-args</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mthreads</code><dd><a name="index-mthreads-995"></a>Support thread-safe exception handling on <span class="samp">Mingw32</span>.  Code that relies
on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all code with the
<span class="option">-mthreads</span> option.  When compiling, <span class="option">-mthreads</span> defines
<span class="option">-D_MT</span>; when linking, it links in a special thread helper library
<span class="option">-lmingwthrd</span> which cleans up per thread exception handling data.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-align-stringops</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dalign_002dstringops-996"></a>Do not align destination of inlined string operations.  This switch reduces
code size and improves performance in case the destination is already aligned,
but gcc don't know about it.

     <br><dt><code>-minline-all-stringops</code><dd><a name="index-minline_002dall_002dstringops-997"></a>By default GCC inlines string operations only when destination is known to be
aligned at least to 4 byte boundary.  This enables more inlining, increase code
size, but may improve performance of code that depends on fast memcpy, strlen
and memset for short lengths.

avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions.  The option
<span class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</span> removes the frame pointer for all functions
which might make debugging harder.

The 32-bit environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits and
generates code that runs on any i386 system. 
The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer

     <br><dt><code>-mno-red-zone</code><dd><a name="index-no_002dred_002dzone-1001"></a>Do not use a so called red zone for x86-64 code.  The red zone is mandated
by the x86-64 ABI, it is a 128-byte area beyond the location of the
stack pointer that will not be modified by signal or interrupt handlers
and therefore can be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack

     <dl>
<dt><code>-march=</code><var>architecture-type</var><dd><a name="index-march-1007"></a>Generate code for the specified architecture.  The choices for
<var>architecture-type</var> are <span class="samp">1.0</span> for PA 1.0, <span class="samp">1.1</span> for PA
1.1, and <span class="samp">2.0</span> for PA 2.0 processors.  Refer to
<span class="file">/usr/lib/sched.models</span> on an HP-UX system to determine the proper
architecture option for your machine.  Code compiled for lower numbered
architectures will run on higher numbered architectures, but not the
other way around.

     <p>PA 2.0 support currently requires gas snapshot 19990413 or later.  The
next release of binutils (current is 2.9.1) will probably contain PA 2.0
support.

     <br><dt><code>-mbig-switch</code><dd><a name="index-mbig_002dswitch-1011"></a>Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only if
the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches within a switch
table.

     <br><dt><code>-mjump-in-delay</code><dd><a name="index-mjump_002din_002ddelay-1012"></a>Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump instructions
by modifying the return pointer for the function call to be the target
of the conditional jump.

     <br><dt><code>-mdisable-fpregs</code><dd><a name="index-mdisable_002dfpregs-1013"></a>Prevent floating point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels which perform lazy context switching of
floating point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating point operations, the compiler will abort.

     <br><dt><code>-mdisable-indexing</code><dd><a name="index-mdisable_002dindexing-1014"></a>Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-space-regs</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dspace_002dregs-1015"></a>Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.

     <p>Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.

     <br><dt><code>-mfast-indirect-calls</code><dd><a name="index-mfast_002dindirect_002dcalls-1016"></a>Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.  This
allows GCC to emit code which performs faster indirect calls.

     <p>This option will not work in the presence of shared libraries or nested
functions.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-load-store</code><dd><a name="index-mlong_002dload_002dstore-1017"></a>Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by
the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the <span class="samp">+k</span> option to
the HP compilers.

     <br><dt><code>-mportable-runtime</code><dd><a name="index-mportable_002druntime-1018"></a>Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF systems.

     <br><dt><code>-mgas</code><dd><a name="index-mgas-1019"></a>Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.

     <br><dt><code>-mschedule=</code><var>cpu-type</var><dd><a name="index-mschedule-1020"></a>Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type

<span class="samp">8000</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mlinker-opt</code><dd><a name="index-mlinker_002dopt-1021"></a>Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.

     <br><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-1022"></a>Generate output containing library calls for floating point. 
<strong>Warning:</strong> the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded target <span class="samp">hppa1.1-*-pro</span>
does provide software floating point support.

     <p><span class="option">-msoft-float</span> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <span class="file">libgcc.a</span>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <span class="option">-msoft-float</span> in order for
this to work.

     <br><dt><code>-msio</code><dd><a name="index-msio-1023"></a>Generate the predefine, <code>_SIO</code>, for server IO.  The default is
<span class="option">-mwsio</span>.  This generates the predefines, <code>__hp9000s700</code>,
<code>__hp9000s700__</code> and <code>_WSIO</code>, for workstation IO.  These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.

     <br><dt><code>-mgnu-ld</code><dd><a name="index-gnu_002dld-1024"></a>Use GNU ld specific options.  This passes <span class="option">-shared</span> to ld when
building a shared library.  It is the default when GCC is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker.  This option does not
have any affect on which ld is called, it only changes what parameters
are passed to that ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the
<span class="option">--with-ld</span> configure option, gcc's program search path, and
finally by the user's <span class="env">PATH</span>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed
using <span class="samp">which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mhp-ld</code><dd><a name="index-hp_002dld-1025"></a>Use HP ld specific options.  This passes <span class="option">-b</span> to ld when building
a shared library and passes <span class="option">+Accept TypeMismatch</span> to ld on all
links.  It is the default when GCC is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option does not have any affect on
which ld is called, it only changes what parameters are passed to that
ld.  The ld that is called is determined by the <span class="option">--with-ld</span>
configure option, gcc's program search path, and finally by the user's
<span class="env">PATH</span>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed using <span class="samp">which
`gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mlong-calls</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dlong_002dcalls-1026"></a>Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.

     <p>Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
<span class="option">-ffunction-sections</span> option, or when using the <span class="option">-mgas</span>
and <span class="option">-mno-portable-runtime</span> options together under HP-UX with
the SOM linker.

     <p>It is normally not desirable to use this option as it will degrade
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.

     <p>The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small. 
However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code
and it is quite long.

     <br><dt><code>-nolibdld</code><dd><a name="index-nolibdld-1027"></a>Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
<span class="option">-static</span> option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.

     <br><dt><code>-static</code><dd><a name="index-static-1028"></a>The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the <span class="option">-static</span> option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.

     <p>On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the <span class="option">-static</span> option is specified. 
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
<span class="option">-nolibdld</span> option can be used to prevent the GCC driver from
adding these link options.

     <br><dt><code>-threads</code><dd><a name="index-threads-1029"></a>Add support for multithreading with the <dfn>dce thread</dfn> library
under HP-UX.  This option sets flags for both the preprocessor and
linker.

<h4 class="subsection">3.17.17 DEC Alpha Options</h4>

<p>These <span class="samp">-m</span> options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mno-soft-float</code><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dsoft_002dfloat-1056"></a><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-1057"></a>Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When <span class="option">-msoft-float</span> is specified,
functions in <span class="file">libgcc.a</span> will be used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines will issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.

     <p>Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.

     <br><dt><code>-mfp-reg</code><dt><code>-mno-fp-regs</code><dd><a name="index-mfp_002dreg-1058"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfp_002dregs-1059"></a>Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set. 
<span class="option">-mno-fp-regs</span> implies <span class="option">-msoft-float</span>.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in <code>$0</code> instead of <code>$f0</code>.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with <span class="option">-mno-fp-regs</span> must also be compiled with that
option.

     <p>A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.

     <br><dt><code>-mieee</code><dd><a name="index-mieee-1060"></a>The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the IEEE floating
point standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE compliant code
<em>except</em> that the <var>inexact-flag</var> is not maintained (see below). 
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro <code>_IEEE_FP</code> is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional IEEE
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option <span class="option">-ieee_with_no_inexact</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mieee-with-inexact</code><dd><a name="index-mieee_002dwith_002dinexact-1061"></a>This is like <span class="option">-mieee</span> except the generated code also maintains
the IEEE <var>inexact-flag</var>.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  In addition to
<code>_IEEE_FP</code>, <code>_IEEE_FP_EXACT</code> is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the <var>inexact-flag</var>, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option <span class="option">-ieee_with_inexact</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mfp-trap-mode=</code><var>trap-mode</var><dd><a name="index-mfp_002dtrap_002dmode-1062"></a>This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled. 
Other Alpha compilers call this option <span class="option">-fptm </span><var>trap-mode</var>. 
The trap mode can be set to one of four values:

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">n</span><dd>This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">u</span><dd>In addition to the traps enabled by <span class="samp">n</span>, underflow traps are enabled
as well.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">su</span><dd>Like <span class="samp">su</span>, but the instructions are marked to be safe for software
completion (see Alpha architecture manual for details).

          <br><dt><span class="samp">sui</span><dd>Like <span class="samp">su</span>, but inexact traps are enabled as well. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>-mfp-rounding-mode=</code><var>rounding-mode</var><dd><a name="index-mfp_002drounding_002dmode-1063"></a>Selects the IEEE rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
<span class="option">-fprm </span><var>rounding-mode</var>.  The <var>rounding-mode</var> can be one
of:

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">n</span><dd>Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">m</span><dd>Round towards minus infinity.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">c</span><dd>Chopped rounding mode.  Floating point numbers are rounded towards zero.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">d</span><dd>Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating point control register
(<var>fpcr</var>, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
<var>fpcr</var>, <span class="samp">d</span> corresponds to round towards plus infinity. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>-mtrap-precision=</code><var>trap-precision</var><dd><a name="index-mtrap_002dprecision-1064"></a>In the Alpha architecture, floating point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated. 
GCC can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating point trap. 
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">p</span><dd>Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating point exception.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">f</span><dd>Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating point exception.

          <br><dt><span class="samp">i</span><dd>Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating point exception. 
</dl>

     <p>Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
<span class="option">-scope_safe</span> and <span class="option">-resumption_safe</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mieee-conformant</code><dd><a name="index-mieee_002dconformant-1065"></a>This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify <span class="option">-mtrap-precision=i</span> and either
<span class="option">-mfp-trap-mode=su</span> or <span class="option">-mfp-trap-mode=sui</span>.  Its only effect
is to emit the line <span class="samp">.eflag 48</span> in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.  Under DEC Unix, this has the effect that
IEEE-conformant math library routines will be linked in.

     <br><dt><code>-mbuild-constants</code><dd><a name="index-mbuild_002dconstants-1066"></a>Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it will output the constant as a literal and
generate code to load it from the data segment at runtime.

     <p>Use this option to require GCC to construct <em>all</em> integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).

     <p>You would typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.

     <br><dt><code>-malpha-as</code><dt><code>-mgas</code><dd><a name="index-malpha_002das-1067"></a><a name="index-mgas-1068"></a>Select whether to generate code to be assembled by the vendor-supplied
assembler (<span class="option">-malpha-as</span>) or by the GNU assembler <span class="option">-mgas</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mbwx</code><dt><code>-mno-bwx</code><dt><code>-mcix</code><dt><code>-mno-cix</code><dt><code>-mfix</code><dt><code>-mno-fix</code><dt><code>-mmax</code><dt><code>-mno-max</code><dd><a name="index-mbwx-1069"></a><a name="index-mno_002dbwx-1070"></a><a name="index-mcix-1071"></a><a name="index-mno_002dcix-1072"></a><a name="index-mfix-1073"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfix-1074"></a><a name="index-mmax-1075"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmax-1076"></a>Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional BWX,
CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets.  The default is to use the instruction
sets supported by the CPU type specified via <span class="option">-mcpu=</span> option or that
of the CPU on which GCC was built if none was specified.

     <br><dt><code>-mfloat-vax</code><dt><code>-mfloat-ieee</code><dd><a name="index-mfloat_002dvax-1077"></a><a name="index-mfloat_002dieee-1078"></a>Generate code that uses (does not use) VAX F and G floating point
arithmetic instead of IEEE single and double precision.

     <br><dt><code>-mexplicit-relocs</code><dt><code>-mno-explicit-relocs</code><dd><a name="index-mexplicit_002drelocs-1079"></a><a name="index-mno_002dexplicit_002drelocs-1080"></a>Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  GNU binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option
is mostly useful for debugging, as GCC detects the capabilities of
the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.

     <br><dt><code>-msmall-data</code><dt><code>-mlarge-data</code><dd><a name="index-msmall_002ddata-1081"></a><a name="index-mlarge_002ddata-1082"></a>When <span class="option">-mexplicit-relocs</span> is in effect, static data is
accessed via <dfn>gp-relative</dfn> relocations.  When <span class="option">-msmall-data</span>
is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a <dfn>small data area</dfn>
(the <code>.sdata</code> and <code>.sbss</code> sections) and are accessed via
16-bit relocations off of the <code>$gp</code> register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.

     <p>The default is <span class="option">-mlarge-data</span>.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use <code>malloc</code> or <code>mmap</code> to allocate the data in the
heap instead of in the program's data segment.

     <p>When generating code for shared libraries, <span class="option">-fpic</span> implies
<span class="option">-msmall-data</span> and <span class="option">-fPIC</span> implies <span class="option">-mlarge-data</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-1083"></a>Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters for
machine type <var>cpu_type</var>.  You can specify either the <span class="samp">EV</span>
style name or the corresponding chip number.  GCC supports scheduling
parameters for the EV4, EV5 and EV6 family of processors and will
choose the default values for the instruction set from the processor
you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type, GCC will default
to the processor on which the compiler was built.

     <p>Supported values for <var>cpu_type</var> are

     <br><dt><code>-mtune=</code><var>cpu_type</var><dd><a name="index-mtune-1084"></a>Set only the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
<var>cpu_type</var>.  The instruction set is not changed.

     <br><dt><code>-mmemory-latency=</code><var>time</var><dd><a name="index-mmemory_002dlatency-1085"></a>Sets the latency the scheduler should assume for typical memory
references as seen by the application.  This number is highly
dependent on the memory access patterns used by the application
and the size of the external cache on the machine.

     <p>Valid options for <var>time</var> are

<p><a name="index-TMS320C3x_002fC4x-Options-1121"></a>
These <span class="samp">-m</span> options are defined for TMS320C3x/C4x implementations:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>cpu_type</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-1122"></a>Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
parameters for machine type <var>cpu_type</var>.  Supported values for
<var>cpu_type</var> are <span class="samp">c30</span>, <span class="samp">c31</span>, <span class="samp">c32</span>, <span class="samp">c40</span>, and
<span class="samp">c44</span>.  The default is <span class="samp">c40</span> to generate code for the
TMS320C40.

     <br><dt><code>-mbig-memory</code><dt><code>-mbig</code><dt><code>-msmall-memory</code><dt><code>-msmall</code><dd><a name="index-mbig_002dmemory-1123"></a><a name="index-mbig-1124"></a><a name="index-msmall_002dmemory-1125"></a><a name="index-msmall-1126"></a>Generates code for the big or small memory model.  The small memory
model assumed that all data fits into one 64K word page.  At run-time
the data page (DP) register must be set to point to the 64K page
containing the .bss and .data program sections.  The big memory model is
the default and requires reloading of the DP register for every direct
memory access.

     <br><dt><code>-mbk</code><dt><code>-mno-bk</code><dd><a name="index-mbk-1127"></a><a name="index-mno_002dbk-1128"></a>Allow (disallow) allocation of general integer operands into the block
count register BK.

     <br><dt><code>-mdb</code><dt><code>-mno-db</code><dd><a name="index-mdb-1129"></a><a name="index-mno_002ddb-1130"></a>Enable (disable) generation of code using decrement and branch,
DBcond(D), instructions.  This is enabled by default for the C4x.  To be
on the safe side, this is disabled for the C3x, since the maximum
iteration count on the C3x is 2^23 + 1 (but who iterates loops more than
2^23 times on the C3x?).  Note that GCC will try to reverse a loop so
that it can utilize the decrement and branch instruction, but will give
up if there is more than one memory reference in the loop.  Thus a loop
where the loop counter is decremented can generate slightly more
efficient code, in cases where the RPTB instruction cannot be utilized.

     <br><dt><code>-mdp-isr-reload</code><dt><code>-mparanoid</code><dd><a name="index-mdp_002disr_002dreload-1131"></a><a name="index-mparanoid-1132"></a>Force the DP register to be saved on entry to an interrupt service
routine (ISR), reloaded to point to the data section, and restored on
exit from the ISR.  This should not be required unless someone has
violated the small memory model by modifying the DP register, say within
an object library.

     <br><dt><code>-mmpyi</code><dt><code>-mno-mpyi</code><dd><a name="index-mmpyi-1133"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmpyi-1134"></a>For the C3x use the 24-bit MPYI instruction for integer multiplies
instead of a library call to guarantee 32-bit results.  Note that if one
of the operands is a constant, then the multiplication will be performed
using shifts and adds.  If the <span class="option">-mmpyi</span> option is not specified for the C3x,
then squaring operations are performed inline instead of a library call.

     <br><dt><code>-mfast-fix</code><dt><code>-mno-fast-fix</code><dd><a name="index-mfast_002dfix-1135"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfast_002dfix-1136"></a>The C3x/C4x FIX instruction to convert a floating point value to an
integer value chooses the nearest integer less than or equal to the
floating point value rather than to the nearest integer.  Thus if the
floating point number is negative, the result will be incorrectly
truncated an additional code is necessary to detect and correct this
case.  This option can be used to disable generation of the additional
code required to correct the result.

     <br><dt><code>-mrptb</code><dt><code>-mno-rptb</code><dd><a name="index-mrptb-1137"></a><a name="index-mno_002drptb-1138"></a>Enable (disable) generation of repeat block sequences using the RPTB
instruction for zero overhead looping.  The RPTB construct is only used
for innermost loops that do not call functions or jump across the loop
boundaries.  There is no advantage having nested RPTB loops due to the
overhead required to save and restore the RC, RS, and RE registers. 
This is enabled by default with <span class="option">-O2</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mrpts=</code><var>count</var><dt><code>-mno-rpts</code><dd><a name="index-mrpts-1139"></a><a name="index-mno_002drpts-1140"></a>Enable (disable) the use of the single instruction repeat instruction
RPTS.  If a repeat block contains a single instruction, and the loop
count can be guaranteed to be less than the value <var>count</var>, GCC will
emit a RPTS instruction instead of a RPTB.  If no value is specified,
then a RPTS will be emitted even if the loop count cannot be determined
at compile time.  Note that the repeated instruction following RPTS does
not have to be reloaded from memory each iteration, thus freeing up the
CPU buses for operands.  However, since interrupts are blocked by this
instruction, it is disabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mloop-unsigned</code><dt><code>-mno-loop-unsigned</code><dd><a name="index-mloop_002dunsigned-1141"></a><a name="index-mno_002dloop_002dunsigned-1142"></a>The maximum iteration count when using RPTS and RPTB (and DB on the C40)
is 2^31 + 1 since these instructions test if the iteration count is
negative to terminate the loop.  If the iteration count is unsigned
there is a possibility than the 2^31 + 1 maximum iteration count may be
exceeded.  This switch allows an unsigned iteration count.

     <br><dt><code>-mti</code><dd><a name="index-mti-1143"></a>Try to emit an assembler syntax that the TI assembler (asm30) is happy
with.  This also enforces compatibility with the API employed by the TI
C3x C compiler.  For example, long doubles are passed as structures
rather than in floating point registers.

     <br><dt><code>-mregparm</code><dt><code>-mmemparm</code><dd><a name="index-mregparm-1144"></a><a name="index-mmemparm-1145"></a>Generate code that uses registers (stack) for passing arguments to functions. 
By default, arguments are passed in registers where possible rather
than by pushing arguments on to the stack.

     <br><dt><code>-mparallel-insns</code><dt><code>-mno-parallel-insns</code><dd><a name="index-mparallel_002dinsns-1146"></a><a name="index-mno_002dparallel_002dinsns-1147"></a>Allow the generation of parallel instructions.  This is enabled by
default with <span class="option">-O2</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-mparallel-mpy</code><dt><code>-mno-parallel-mpy</code><dd><a name="index-mparallel_002dmpy-1148"></a><a name="index-mno_002dparallel_002dmpy-1149"></a>Allow the generation of MPY||ADD and MPY||SUB parallel instructions,
provided <span class="option">-mparallel-insns</span> is also specified.  These instructions have
tight register constraints which can pessimize the code generation
of large functions.

<h4 class="subsection">3.17.36 Xtensa Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-Xtensa-Options-1387"></a>
The Xtensa architecture is designed to support many different
configurations.  The compiler's default options can be set to match a
particular Xtensa configuration by copying a configuration file into the
GCC sources when building GCC.  The options below may be used to
override the default options.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-mbig-endian</code><dt><code>-mlittle-endian</code><dd><a name="index-mbig_002dendian-1388"></a><a name="index-mlittle_002dendian-1389"></a>Specify big-endian or little-endian byte ordering for the target Xtensa
processor.

     <br><dt><code>-mdensity</code><dt><code>-mno-density</code><dd><a name="index-mdensity-1390"></a><a name="index-mno_002ddensity-1391"></a>Enable or disable use of the optional Xtensa code density instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-mmac16</code><dt><code>-mno-mac16</code><dd><a name="index-mmac16-1392"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmac16-1393"></a>Enable or disable use of the Xtensa MAC16 option.  When enabled, GCC
will generate MAC16 instructions from standard C code, with the
limitation that it will use neither the MR register file nor any
instruction that operates on the MR registers.  When this option is
disabled, GCC will translate 16-bit multiply/accumulate operations to a
combination of core instructions and library calls, depending on whether
any other multiplier options are enabled.

     <br><dt><code>-mmul16</code><dt><code>-mno-mul16</code><dd><a name="index-mmul16-1394"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmul16-1395"></a>Enable or disable use of the 16-bit integer multiplier option.  When
enabled, the compiler will generate 16-bit multiply instructions for
multiplications of 16 bits or smaller in standard C code.  When this
option is disabled, the compiler will either use 32-bit multiply or
MAC16 instructions if they are available or generate library calls to
perform the multiply operations using shifts and adds.

     <br><dt><code>-mmul32</code><dt><code>-mno-mul32</code><dd><a name="index-mmul32-1396"></a><a name="index-mno_002dmul32-1397"></a>Enable or disable use of the 32-bit integer multiplier option.  When
enabled, the compiler will generate 32-bit multiply instructions for
multiplications of 32 bits or smaller in standard C code.  When this
option is disabled, the compiler will generate library calls to perform
the multiply operations using either shifts and adds or 16-bit multiply
instructions if they are available.

     <br><dt><code>-mnsa</code><dt><code>-mno-nsa</code><dd><a name="index-mnsa-1398"></a><a name="index-mno_002dnsa-1399"></a>Enable or disable use of the optional normalization shift amount
(<code>NSA</code>) instructions to implement the built-in <code>ffs</code> function.

     <br><dt><code>-mminmax</code><dt><code>-mno-minmax</code><dd><a name="index-mminmax-1400"></a><a name="index-mno_002dminmax-1401"></a>Enable or disable use of the optional minimum and maximum value
instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-msext</code><dt><code>-mno-sext</code><dd><a name="index-msext-1402"></a><a name="index-mno_002dsext-1403"></a>Enable or disable use of the optional sign extend (<code>SEXT</code>)
instruction.

     <br><dt><code>-mbooleans</code><dt><code>-mno-booleans</code><dd><a name="index-mbooleans-1404"></a><a name="index-mno_002dbooleans-1405"></a>Enable or disable support for the boolean register file used by Xtensa
coprocessors.  This is not typically useful by itself but may be
required for other options that make use of the boolean registers (e.g.,
the floating-point option).

     <br><dt><code>-mhard-float</code><dt><code>-msoft-float</code><dd><a name="index-mhard_002dfloat-1406"></a><a name="index-msoft_002dfloat-1407"></a>Enable or disable use of the floating-point option.  When enabled, GCC
generates floating-point instructions for 32-bit <code>float</code>
operations.  When this option is disabled, GCC generates library calls
to emulate 32-bit floating-point operations using integer instructions. 
Regardless of this option, 64-bit <code>double</code> operations are always
emulated with calls to library functions.

     <br><dt><code>-mfused-madd</code><dt><code>-mno-fused-madd</code><dd><a name="index-mfused_002dmadd-1408"></a><a name="index-mno_002dfused_002dmadd-1409"></a>Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict IEEE 754-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with <em>more</em> bits of
precision than specified by the IEEE standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not
sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
operations.

     <br><dt><code>-mserialize-volatile</code><dt><code>-mno-serialize-volatile</code><dd><a name="index-mserialize_002dvolatile-1410"></a><a name="index-mno_002dserialize_002dvolatile-1411"></a>When this option is enabled, GCC inserts <code>MEMW</code> instructions before
<code>volatile</code> memory references to guarantee sequential consistency. 
The default is <span class="option">-mserialize-volatile</span>.  Use
<span class="option">-mno-serialize-volatile</span> to omit the <code>MEMW</code> instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-mtext-section-literals</code><dt><code>-mno-text-section-literals</code><dd><a name="index-mtext_002dsection_002dliterals-1412"></a><a name="index-mno_002dtext_002dsection_002dliterals-1413"></a>Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
<span class="option">-mno-text-section-literals</span>, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be placed
in a data RAM/ROM, and it also allows the linker to combine literal
pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With <span class="option">-mtext-section-literals</span>, the literals
are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as
possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly
files.

     <br><dt><code>-mtarget-align</code><dt><code>-mno-target-align</code><dd><a name="index-mtarget_002dalign-1414"></a><a name="index-mno_002dtarget_002dalign-1415"></a>When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening will be performed.  The
default is <span class="option">-mtarget-align</span>.  These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like <code>LOOP</code>, which the
assembler will always align, either by widening density instructions or
by inserting no-op instructions.

     <br><dt><code>-mlongcalls</code><dt><code>-mno-longcalls</code><dd><a name="index-mlongcalls-1416"></a><a name="index-mno_002dlongcalls-1417"></a>When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct <code>CALL</code>
instruction into an <code>L32R</code> followed by a <code>CALLX</code> instruction. 
The default is <span class="option">-mno-longcalls</span>.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by GCC will still show direct call
instructions&mdash;look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler will use an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really will be out of range.

These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.

   <p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <span class="option">-ffoo</span> would be <span class="option">-fno-foo</span>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one which is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <span class="samp">no-</span> or adding
it.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fbounds-check</code><dd><a name="index-fbounds_002dcheck-1421"></a>For front-ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran 77 front-ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.

     <br><dt><code>-ftrapv</code><dd><a name="index-ftrapv-1422"></a>This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.

     <br><dt><code>-fexceptions</code><dd><a name="index-fexceptions-1423"></a>Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies GCC will generate frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, GCC will enable it by default for languages like
C++ which normally require exception handling, and disable it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C++.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C++ programs that don't
use exception handling.

     <br><dt><code>-fnon-call-exceptions</code><dd><a name="index-fnon_002dcall_002dexceptions-1424"></a>Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions. 
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows <em>trapping</em>
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating
point instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as <code>SIGALRM</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-funwind-tables</code><dd><a name="index-funwind_002dtables-1425"></a>Similar to <span class="option">-fexceptions</span>, except that it will just generate any needed
static data, but will not affect the generated code in any other way. 
You will normally not enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling would enable it on your behalf.

     <br><dt><code>-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</code><dd><a name="index-funwind_002dtables-1426"></a>Generate unwind table in dwarf2 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).

     <br><dt><code>-fpcc-struct-return</code><dd><a name="index-fpcc_002dstruct_002dreturn-1427"></a>Return &ldquo;short&rdquo; <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

     <p>The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.

     <p>Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> code compiled with the <span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span> switch. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-freg-struct-return</code><dd><a name="index-freg_002dstruct_002dreturn-1428"></a>Return <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> values in registers when possible. 
This is more efficient for small structures than
<span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span>.

     <p>If you specify neither <span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span> nor
<span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span>, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC
defaults to <span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span>, except on targets where GCC is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> code compiled with the <span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span> switch. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-fshort-enums</code><dd><a name="index-fshort_002denums-1429"></a>Allocate to an <code>enum</code> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <code>enum</code> type
will be equivalent to the smallest integer type which has enough room.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <span class="option">-fshort-enums</span> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-fshort-double</code><dd><a name="index-fshort_002ddouble-1430"></a>Use the same size for <code>double</code> as for <code>float</code>.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <span class="option">-fshort-double</span> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-fshort-wchar</code><dd><a name="index-fshort_002dwchar-1431"></a>Override the underlying type for <span class="samp">wchar_t</span> to be <span class="samp">short
unsigned int</span> instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under WINE.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <span class="option">-fshort-wchar</span> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-fshared-data</code><dd><a name="index-fshared_002ddata-1432"></a>Requests that the data and non-<code>const</code> variables of this
compilation be shared data rather than private data.  The distinction
makes sense only on certain operating systems, where shared data is
shared between processes running the same program, while private data
exists in one copy per process.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-common</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dcommon-1433"></a>In C, allocate even uninitialized global variables in the data section of the
object file, rather than generating them as common blocks.  This has the
effect that if the same variable is declared (without <code>extern</code>) in
two different compilations, you will get an error when you link them. 
The only reason this might be useful is if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems which always work this way.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-ident</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dident-1434"></a>Ignore the <span class="samp">#ident</span> directive.

     <br><dt><code>-fno-gnu-linker</code><dd><a name="index-fno_002dgnu_002dlinker-1435"></a>Do not output global initializations (such as C++ constructors and
destructors) in the form used by the GNU linker (on systems where the GNU
linker is the standard method of handling them).  Use this option when
you want to use a non-GNU linker, which also requires using the
<span class="command">collect2</span> program to make sure the system linker includes
constructors and destructors.  (<span class="command">collect2</span> is included in the GCC
distribution.)  For systems which <em>must</em> use <span class="command">collect2</span>, the
compiler driver <span class="command">gcc</span> is configured to do this automatically.

     <br><dt><code>-finhibit-size-directive</code><dd><a name="index-finhibit_002dsize_002ddirective-1436"></a>Don't output a <code>.size</code> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <span class="file">crtstuff.c</span>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.

     <br><dt><code>-fverbose-asm</code><dd><a name="index-fverbose_002dasm-1437"></a>Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).

     <p><span class="option">-fno-verbose-asm</span>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.

     <br><dt><code>-fvolatile</code><dd><a name="index-fvolatile-1438"></a>Consider all memory references through pointers to be volatile.

     <br><dt><code>-fvolatile-global</code><dd><a name="index-fvolatile_002dglobal-1439"></a>Consider all memory references to extern and global data items to
be volatile.  GCC does not consider static data items to be volatile
because of this switch.

     <br><dt><code>-fvolatile-static</code><dd><a name="index-fvolatile_002dstatic-1440"></a>Consider all memory references to static data to be volatile.

     <br><dt><code>-fpic</code><dd><a name="index-fpic-1441"></a><a name="index-global-offset-table-1442"></a><a name="index-PIC-1443"></a>Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).  The dynamic
loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If
the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
<span class="option">-fpic</span> does not work; in that case, recompile with <span class="option">-fPIC</span>
instead.  (These maximums are 16k on the m88k, 8k on the SPARC, and 32k
on the m68k and RS/6000.  The 386 has no such limit.)

     <p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, GCC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.

     <br><dt><code>-fPIC</code><dd><a name="index-fPIC-1444"></a>If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k, m88k,
and the SPARC.

     <p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.

     <br><dt><code>-ffixed-</code><var>reg</var><dd><a name="index-ffixed-1445"></a>Treat the register named <var>reg</var> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).

     <p><var>reg</var> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <code>REGISTER_NAMES</code>
macro in the machine description macro file.

     <p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

     <br><dt><code>-fcall-used-</code><var>reg</var><dd><a name="index-fcall_002dused-1446"></a>Treat the register named <var>reg</var> as an allocable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
will not save and restore the register <var>reg</var>.

     <p>It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer. 
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.

     <p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

     <br><dt><code>-fcall-saved-</code><var>reg</var><dd><a name="index-fcall_002dsaved-1447"></a>Treat the register named <var>reg</var> as an allocable register saved by
functions.  It may be allocated even for temporaries or variables that
live across a call.  Functions compiled this way will save and restore
the register <var>reg</var> if they use it.

     <p>It is an error to used this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer. 
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model will produce disastrous results.

     <p>A different sort of disaster will result from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.

     <p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.

     <br><dt><code>-fpack-struct</code><dd><a name="index-fpack_002dstruct-1448"></a>Pack all structure members together without holes.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <span class="option">-fpack-struct</span> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch. 
Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal. 
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.

     <br><dt><code>-finstrument-functions</code><dd><a name="index-finstrument_002dfunctions-1449"></a>Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions will be called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<code>__builtin_return_address</code> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

     <pre class="example">          void __cyg_profile_func_enter (void *this_fn,
                                         void *call_site);
          void __cyg_profile_func_exit  (void *this_fn,
                                         void *call_site);
     </pre>
     <p>The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.

     <p>This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <span class="samp">extern inline</span> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)

     <p>A function may be given the attribute <code>no_instrument_function</code>, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

     <br><dt><code>-fstack-check</code><dd><a name="index-fstack_002dcheck-1450"></a>Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.

     <p>Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system must do that.  The switch causes generation of code
to ensure that the operating system sees the stack being extended.

     <br><dt><code>-fstack-limit-register=</code><var>reg</var><dt><code>-fstack-limit-symbol=</code><var>sym</var><dt><code>-fno-stack-limit</code><dd><a name="index-fstack_002dlimit_002dregister-1451"></a><a name="index-fstack_002dlimit_002dsymbol-1452"></a><a name="index-fno_002dstack_002dlimit-1453"></a>Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If the stack
would grow beyond the value, a signal is raised.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.

     <p>For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address <span class="samp">0x80000000</span>
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
<span class="option">-fstack-limit-symbol=__stack_limit</span> and
<span class="option">-Wl,--defsym,__stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</span> to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.

each other, but may alias global storage.<br>
<span class="option">-fargument-noalias-global</span> specifies that arguments do not

     <p>Each language will automatically use whatever option is required by
the language standard.  You should not need to use these options yourself.

is to help link with legacy assembly code.

     <p><strong>Warning:</strong> the <span class="option">-fleading-underscore</span> switch causes GCC to

<h3 class="section">3.19 Environment Variables Affecting GCC</h3>

<p><a name="index-environment-variables-1460"></a>
<!-- man begin ENVIRONMENT -->
This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.

   <p>Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<span class="option">-B</span>, <span class="option">-I</span> and <span class="option">-L</span> (see <a href="#Directory-Options">Directory Options</a>).  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GCC. 
See <a href="{No value for `fngccint'}.html#Driver">Controlling the Compilation Driver <span class="file">gcc</span> (GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals)</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><span class="env">LANG</span><dt><span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span><dd><!-- @itemx LC_COLLATE -->
<dt><span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span><dd><!-- @itemx LC_MONETARY -->
<!-- @itemx LC_NUMERIC -->
<!-- @itemx LC_TIME -->
<dt><span class="env">LC_ALL</span><dd><a name="index-LANG-1461"></a><a name="index-LC_005fCTYPE-1462"></a><!-- @findex LC_COLLATE -->
<a name="index-LC_005fMESSAGES-1463"></a><!-- @findex LC_MONETARY -->
<!-- @findex LC_NUMERIC -->
<!-- @findex LC_TIME -->
<a name="index-LC_005fALL-1464"></a><a name="index-locale-1465"></a>These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information that allow GCC to work with different
national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
<span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span> and <span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is <span class="samp">en_GB</span> for English in the United
Kingdom.

     <p>The <span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span> environment variable specifies character
classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.

     <p>The <span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.

     <p>If the <span class="env">LC_ALL</span> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of <span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span> and <span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span>; otherwise, <span class="env">LC_CTYPE</span>
and <span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span> default to the value of the <span class="env">LANG</span>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC
defaults to traditional C English behavior.

     <br><dt><span class="env">TMPDIR</span><dd><a name="index-TMPDIR-1466"></a>If <span class="env">TMPDIR</span> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.

     <br><dt><span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span><dd><a name="index-GCC_005fEXEC_005fPREFIX-1467"></a>If <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

     <p>If <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span> is not set, GCC will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.

     <p>If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.

     <p>The default value of <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span> is
<var>prefix</var><span class="file">/lib/gcc-lib/</span> where <var>prefix</var> is the value
of <code>prefix</code> when you ran the <span class="file">configure</span> script.

     <p>Other prefixes specified with <span class="option">-B</span> take precedence over this prefix.

     <p>This prefix is also used for finding files such as <span class="file">crt0.o</span> that are
used for linking.

     <p>In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <span class="samp">/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib</span>
(more precisely, with the value of <span class="env">GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</span>), GCC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <span class="option">-Bfoo/</span>, GCC will search
<span class="file">foo/bar</span> where it would normally search <span class="file">/usr/local/lib/bar</span>. 
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.

     <br><dt><span class="env">COMPILER_PATH</span><dd><a name="index-COMPILER_005fPATH-1468"></a>The value of <span class="env">COMPILER_PATH</span> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <span class="env">PATH</span>.  GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span>.

     <br><dt><span class="env">LIBRARY_PATH</span><dd><a name="index-LIBRARY_005fPATH-1469"></a>The value of <span class="env">LIBRARY_PATH</span> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <span class="env">PATH</span>.  When configured as a native compiler,
GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using <span class="env">GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</span>.  Linking
using GCC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <span class="option">-l</span> option (but directories specified with
<span class="option">-L</span> come first).

     <br><dt><span class="env">LANG</span><dd><a name="index-LANG-1470"></a><a name="index-locale-definition-1471"></a>This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and C++. 
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for <span class="env">LANG</span> are recognized:

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">C-JIS</span><dd>Recognize JIS characters. 
<br><dt><span class="samp">C-SJIS</span><dd>Recognize SJIS characters. 
<br><dt><span class="samp">C-EUCJP</span><dd>Recognize EUCJP characters. 
</dl>

     <p>If <span class="env">LANG</span> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters. 
</dl>

preprocessor.

Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <span class="env">PATH</span>, in which to look for header files. 
The special character, <code>PATH_SEPARATOR</code>, is target-dependent and
determined at GCC build time.  For Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.

     <p><span class="env">CPATH</span> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <span class="option">-I</span>, but after any paths given with <span class="option">-I</span>
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.

     <p>The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with <span class="option">-isystem</span>, but after any
paths given with <span class="option">-isystem</span> options on the command line.

     <p>In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the

<h3 class="section">3.20 Running Protoize</h3>

<p>The program <code>protoize</code> is an optional part of GCC.  You can use
it to add prototypes to a program, thus converting the program to ISO
C in one respect.  The companion program <code>unprotoize</code> does the
reverse: it removes argument types from any prototypes that are found.

   <p>When you run these programs, you must specify a set of source files as
command line arguments.  The conversion programs start out by compiling
these files to see what functions they define.  The information gathered
about a file <var>foo</var> is saved in a file named <var>foo</var><span class="file">.X</span>.

   <p>After scanning comes actual conversion.  The specified files are all
eligible to be converted; any files they include (whether sources or
just headers) are eligible as well.

   <p>But not all the eligible files are converted.  By default,
<code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code> convert only source and header
files in the current directory.  You can specify additional directories
whose files should be converted with the <span class="option">-d </span><var>directory</var>
option.  You can also specify particular files to exclude with the
<span class="option">-x </span><var>file</var> option.  A file is converted if it is eligible, its
directory name matches one of the specified directory names, and its
name within the directory has not been excluded.

   <p>Basic conversion with <code>protoize</code> consists of rewriting most
function definitions and function declarations to specify the types of
the arguments.  The only ones not rewritten are those for varargs
functions.

   <p><code>protoize</code> optionally inserts prototype declarations at the
beginning of the source file, to make them available for any calls that
precede the function's definition.  Or it can insert prototype
declarations with block scope in the blocks where undeclared functions
are called.

   <p>Basic conversion with <code>unprotoize</code> consists of rewriting most
function declarations to remove any argument types, and rewriting
function definitions to the old-style pre-ISO form.

   <p>Both conversion programs print a warning for any function declaration or
definition that they can't convert.  You can suppress these warnings
with <span class="option">-q</span>.

   <p>The output from <code>protoize</code> or <code>unprotoize</code> replaces the
original source file.  The original file is renamed to a name ending
with <span class="samp">.save</span> (for DOS, the saved filename ends in <span class="samp">.sav</span>
without the original <span class="samp">.c</span> suffix).  If the <span class="samp">.save</span> (<span class="samp">.sav</span>
for DOS) file already exists, then the source file is simply discarded.

   <p><code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code> both depend on GCC itself to
scan the program and collect information about the functions it uses. 
So neither of these programs will work until GCC is installed.

   <p>Here is a table of the options you can use with <code>protoize</code> and
<code>unprotoize</code>.  Each option works with both programs unless
otherwise stated.

     <dl>
<dt><code>-B </code><var>directory</var><dd>Look for the file <span class="file">SYSCALLS.c.X</span> in <var>directory</var>, instead of the
usual directory (normally <span class="file">/usr/local/lib</span>).  This file contains
prototype information about standard system functions.  This option
applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-c </code><var>compilation-options</var><dd>Use <var>compilation-options</var> as the options when running <span class="command">gcc</span> to
produce the <span class="samp">.X</span> files.  The special option <span class="option">-aux-info</span> is
always passed in addition, to tell <span class="command">gcc</span> to write a <span class="samp">.X</span> file.

     <p>Note that the compilation options must be given as a single argument to
<code>protoize</code> or <code>unprotoize</code>.  If you want to specify several
<span class="command">gcc</span> options, you must quote the entire set of compilation options
to make them a single word in the shell.

     <p>There are certain <span class="command">gcc</span> arguments that you cannot use, because they
would produce the wrong kind of output.  These include <span class="option">-g</span>,
<span class="option">-O</span>, <span class="option">-c</span>, <span class="option">-S</span>, and <span class="option">-o</span> If you include these in
the <var>compilation-options</var>, they are ignored.

     <br><dt><code>-C</code><dd>Rename files to end in <span class="samp">.C</span> (<span class="samp">.cc</span> for DOS-based file
systems) instead of <span class="samp">.c</span>.  This is convenient if you are converting
a C program to C++.  This option applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-g</code><dd>Add explicit global declarations.  This means inserting explicit
declarations at the beginning of each source file for each function
that is called in the file and was not declared.  These declarations
precede the first function definition that contains a call to an
undeclared function.  This option applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-i </code><var>string</var><dd>Indent old-style parameter declarations with the string <var>string</var>. 
This option applies only to <code>protoize</code>.

     <p><code>unprotoize</code> converts prototyped function definitions to old-style
function definitions, where the arguments are declared between the
argument list and the initial <span class="samp">{</span>.  By default, <code>unprotoize</code>
uses five spaces as the indentation.  If you want to indent with just
one space instead, use <span class="option">-i " "</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-k</code><dd>Keep the <span class="samp">.X</span> files.  Normally, they are deleted after conversion
is finished.

     <br><dt><code>-l</code><dd>Add explicit local declarations.  <code>protoize</code> with <span class="option">-l</span> inserts
a prototype declaration for each function in each block which calls the
function without any declaration.  This option applies only to
<code>protoize</code>.

     <br><dt><code>-n</code><dd>Make no real changes.  This mode just prints information about the conversions
that would have been done without <span class="option">-n</span>.

     <br><dt><code>-N</code><dd>Make no <span class="samp">.save</span> files.  The original files are simply deleted. 
Use this option with caution.

     <br><dt><code>-p </code><var>program</var><dd>Use the program <var>program</var> as the compiler.  Normally, the name
<span class="file">gcc</span> is used.

     <br><dt><code>-q</code><dd>Work quietly.  Most warnings are suppressed.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd>Print the version number, just like <span class="option">-v</span> for <span class="command">gcc</span>. 
</dl>

   <p>If you need special compiler options to compile one of your program's
source files, then you should generate that file's <span class="samp">.X</span> file
specially, by running <span class="command">gcc</span> on that source file with the
appropriate options and the option <span class="option">-aux-info</span>.  Then run
<code>protoize</code> on the entire set of files.  <code>protoize</code> will use
the existing <span class="samp">.X</span> file because it is newer than the source file. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     gcc -Dfoo=bar file1.c -aux-info file1.X
     protoize *.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You need to include the special files along with the rest in the
<code>protoize</code> command, even though their <span class="samp">.X</span> files already
exist, because otherwise they won't get converted.

   <p>See <a href="#Protoize-Caveats">Protoize Caveats</a>, for more information on how to use
<code>protoize</code> successfully.

<!-- ??? We've always claimed that pointers were unsigned entities. -->

<!-- a signed integral type.  On the other hand, it might be most useful -->
<!-- for the target if we extend according to POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED. -->

     <p>A cast from integer to pointer discards most-significant bits if the
pointer representation is smaller than the integer type, extends according
to the signedness of the integer type if the pointer representation
is larger than the integer type, otherwise the bits are unchanged.

<li><cite>The extent to which suggestions made by using the </cite><code>register</code><cite>
storage-class specifier are effective (6.7.1).</cite>

     <p>The <code>register</code> specifier affects code generation only in these ways:

          <ul>
<li>When used as part of the register variable extension, see
<a href="#Explicit-Reg-Vars">Explicit Reg Vars</a>.

          <li>When <span class="option">-O0</span> is in use, the compiler allocates distinct stack
memory for all variables that do not have the <code>register</code>
storage-class specifier; if <code>register</code> is specified, the variable
may have a shorter lifespan than the code would indicate and may never
be placed in memory.

          <li>On some rare x86 targets, <code>setjmp</code> doesn't save the registers in
all circumstances.  In those cases, GCC doesn't allocate any variables
in registers unless they are marked <code>register</code>.

     </ul>

     <li><cite>The extent to which suggestions made by using the inline function
specifier are effective (6.7.4).</cite>

     <p>GCC will not inline any functions if the <span class="option">-fno-inline</span> option is
used or if <span class="option">-O0</span> is used.  Otherwise, GCC may still be unable to
inline a function for many reasons; the <span class="option">-Winline</span> option may be
used to determine if a function has not been inlined and why not.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Statements and Declarations in Expressions</h3>

<p><a name="index-statements-inside-expressions-1484"></a><a name="index-declarations-inside-expressions-1485"></a><a name="index-expressions-containing-statements-1486"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-statements-in-expressions-1487"></a>
<!-- the above section title wrapped and causes an underfull hbox.. i -->
<!-- changed it from "within" to "in". -mew 4feb93 -->
A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.

   <p>Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements surrounded
by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the braces.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     ({ int y = foo (); int z;
        if (y &gt; 0) z = y;
        else z = - y;
        z; })
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression
for the absolute value of <code>foo ()</code>.

   <p>The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type <code>void</code>, and thus
effectively no value.)

   <p>This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions &ldquo;safe&rdquo; (so
that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
&ldquo;maximum&rdquo; function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:

<pre class="example">     #define max(a,b) ((a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-side-effects_002c-macro-argument-1488"></a>But this definition computes either <var>a</var> or <var>b</var> twice, with bad
results if the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the
type of the operands (here let's assume <code>int</code>), you can define
the macro safely as follows:

<pre class="example">     #define maxint(a,b) \
       ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</pre>
   <p>Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit-field, or
the initial value of a static variable.

   <p>If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but you
must use <code>typeof</code> (see <a href="#Typeof">Typeof</a>).

   <p>Statement expressions are not supported fully in G++, and their fate
there is unclear.  (It is possible that they will become fully supported
at some point, or that they will be deprecated, or that the bugs that
are present will continue to exist indefinitely.)  Presently, statement
expressions do not work well as default arguments.

   <p>In addition, there are semantic issues with statement-expressions in
C++.  If you try to use statement-expressions instead of inline
functions in C++, you may be surprised at the way object destruction is
handled.  For example:

<pre class="example">     #define foo(a)  ({int b = (a); b + 3; })
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">does not work the same way as:

<pre class="example">     inline int foo(int a) { int b = a; return b + 3; }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In particular, if the expression passed into <code>foo</code> involves the
creation of temporaries, the destructors for those temporaries will be
run earlier in the case of the macro than in the case of the function.

   <p>These considerations mean that it is probably a bad idea to use
statement-expressions of this form in header files that are designed to
work with C++.  (Note that some versions of the GNU C Library contained
header files using statement-expression that lead to precisely this
bug.)

<h3 class="section">5.2 Locally Declared Labels</h3>

<p><a name="index-local-labels-1489"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-local-labels-1490"></a>
Each statement expression is a scope in which <dfn>local labels</dfn> can be
declared.  A local label is simply an identifier; you can jump to it
with an ordinary <code>goto</code> statement, but only from within the
statement expression it belongs to.

   <p>A local label declaration looks like this:

<pre class="example">     __label__ <var>label</var>;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="example">     __label__ <var>label1</var>, <var>label2</var>, /* <span class="roman">...</span> */;
</pre>
   <p>Local label declarations must come at the beginning of the statement
expression, right after the <span class="samp">({</span>, before any ordinary
declarations.

   <p>The label declaration defines the label <em>name</em>, but does not define
the label itself.  You must do this in the usual way, with
<var>label</var><code>:</code>, within the statements of the statement expression.

   <p>The local label feature is useful because statement expressions are
often used in macros.  If the macro contains nested loops, a <code>goto</code>
can be useful for breaking out of them.  However, an ordinary label
whose scope is the whole function cannot be used: if the macro can be
expanded several times in one function, the label will be multiply
defined in that function.  A local label avoids this problem.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     #define SEARCH(array, target)                     \
     ({                                                \
       __label__ found;                                \
       typeof (target) _SEARCH_target = (target);      \
       typeof (*(array)) *_SEARCH_array = (array);     \
       int i, j;                                       \
       int value;                                      \
       for (i = 0; i &lt; max; i++)                       \
         for (j = 0; j &lt; max; j++)                     \
           if (_SEARCH_array[i][j] == _SEARCH_target)  \
             { value = i; goto found; }                \
       value = -1;                                     \
      found:                                           \
       value;                                          \

<h3 class="section">5.3 Labels as Values</h3>

<p><a name="index-labels-as-values-1491"></a><a name="index-computed-gotos-1492"></a><a name="index-goto-with-computed-label-1493"></a><a name="index-address-of-a-label-1494"></a>
You can get the address of a label defined in the current function
(or a containing function) with the unary operator <span class="samp">&amp;&amp;</span>.  The
value has type <code>void *</code>.  This value is a constant and can be used
wherever a constant of that type is valid.  For example:

<pre class="example">     void *ptr;
     /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     ptr = &amp;&amp;foo;
</pre>
   <p>To use these values, you need to be able to jump to one.  This is done
with the computed goto statement<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a>, <code>goto *</code><var>exp</var><code>;</code>.  For example,

<pre class="example">     goto *ptr;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Any expression of type <code>void *</code> is allowed.

   <p>One way of using these constants is in initializing a static array that
will serve as a jump table:

<pre class="example">     static void *array[] = { &amp;&amp;foo, &amp;&amp;bar, &amp;&amp;hack };
</pre>
   <p>Then you can select a label with indexing, like this:

<pre class="example">     goto *array[i];
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that this does not check whether the subscript is in bounds&mdash;array
indexing in C never does that.

   <p>Such an array of label values serves a purpose much like that of the
<code>switch</code> statement.  The <code>switch</code> statement is cleaner, so
use that rather than an array unless the problem does not fit a
<code>switch</code> statement very well.

   <p>Another use of label values is in an interpreter for threaded code. 
The labels within the interpreter function can be stored in the
threaded code for super-fast dispatching.

   <p>You may not use this mechanism to jump to code in a different function. 
If you do that, totally unpredictable things will happen.  The best way to
avoid this is to store the label address only in automatic variables and
never pass it as an argument.

   <p>An alternate way to write the above example is

<pre class="example">     static const int array[] = { &amp;&amp;foo - &amp;&amp;foo, &amp;&amp;bar - &amp;&amp;foo,
                                  &amp;&amp;hack - &amp;&amp;foo };
     goto *(&amp;&amp;foo + array[i]);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is more friendly to code living in shared libraries, as it reduces
the number of dynamic relocations that are needed, and by consequence,
allows the data to be read-only.

<h3 class="section">5.4 Nested Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-nested-functions-1495"></a><a name="index-downward-funargs-1496"></a><a name="index-thunks-1497"></a>
A <dfn>nested function</dfn> is a function defined inside another function. 
(Nested functions are not supported for GNU C++.)  The nested function's
name is local to the block where it is defined.  For example, here we
define a nested function named <code>square</code>, and call it twice:

<pre class="example">     foo (double a, double b)
     {
       double square (double z) { return z * z; }
     
       return square (a) + square (b);
     }
</pre>
   <p>The nested function can access all the variables of the containing
function that are visible at the point of its definition.  This is
called <dfn>lexical scoping</dfn>.  For example, here we show a nested
function which uses an inherited variable named <code>offset</code>:

<pre class="example">     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       int access (int *array, int index)
         { return array[index + offset]; }
       int i;
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
       for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
         /* <span class="roman">...</span> */ access (array, i) /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
   <p>Nested function definitions are permitted within functions in the places
where variable definitions are allowed; that is, in any block, before
the first statement in the block.

   <p>It is possible to call the nested function from outside the scope of its
name by storing its address or passing the address to another function:

<pre class="example">     hack (int *array, int size)
     {
       void store (int index, int value)
         { array[index] = value; }
     
       intermediate (store, size);
     }
</pre>
   <p>Here, the function <code>intermediate</code> receives the address of
<code>store</code> as an argument.  If <code>intermediate</code> calls <code>store</code>,
the arguments given to <code>store</code> are used to store into <code>array</code>. 
But this technique works only so long as the containing function
(<code>hack</code>, in this example) does not exit.

   <p>If you try to call the nested function through its address after the
containing function has exited, all hell will break loose.  If you try
to call it after a containing scope level has exited, and if it refers
to some of the variables that are no longer in scope, you may be lucky,
but it's not wise to take the risk.  If, however, the nested function
does not refer to anything that has gone out of scope, you should be
safe.

   <p>GCC implements taking the address of a nested function using a technique
called <dfn>trampolines</dfn>.  A paper describing them is available as

<p class="noindent"><a href="http://people.debian.org/~aaronl/Usenix88-lexic.pdf">http://people.debian.org/~aaronl/Usenix88-lexic.pdf</a>.

   <p>A nested function can jump to a label inherited from a containing
function, provided the label was explicitly declared in the containing
function (see <a href="#Local-Labels">Local Labels</a>).  Such a jump returns instantly to the
containing function, exiting the nested function which did the
<code>goto</code> and any intermediate functions as well.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     bar (int *array, int offset, int size)
     {
       __label__ failure;
       int access (int *array, int index)
         {
           if (index &gt; size)
             goto failure;
           return array[index + offset];
         }
       int i;
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
       for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
         /* <span class="roman">...</span> */ access (array, i) /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
       return 0;
     
      /* <span class="roman">Control comes here from </span><code>access</code><span class="roman">
         if it detects an error.</span>  */
      failure:
       return -1;

   <p>A nested function always has internal linkage.  Declaring one with
<code>extern</code> is erroneous.  If you need to declare the nested function
before its definition, use <code>auto</code> (which is otherwise meaningless
for function declarations).

         {
           if (index &gt; size)
             goto failure;
           return array[index + offset];

Using the built-in functions described below, you can record
the arguments a function received, and call another function
with the same arguments, without knowing the number or types
of the arguments.

   <p>You can also record the return value of that function call,
and later return that value, without knowing what data type
the function tried to return (as long as your caller expects
that data type).

<h3 class="section">5.6 Referring to a Type with <code>typeof</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-typeof-1503"></a><a name="index-sizeof-1504"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-types-of-arguments-1505"></a>
Another way to refer to the type of an expression is with <code>typeof</code>. 
The syntax of using of this keyword looks like <code>sizeof</code>, but the
construct acts semantically like a type name defined with <code>typedef</code>.

   <p>There are two ways of writing the argument to <code>typeof</code>: with an
expression or with a type.  Here is an example with an expression:

<pre class="example">     typeof (x[0](1))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This assumes that <code>x</code> is an array of pointers to functions;
the type described is that of the values of the functions.

   <p>Here is an example with a typename as the argument:

<pre class="example">     typeof (int *)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here the type described is that of pointers to <code>int</code>.

   <p>If you are writing a header file that must work when included in ISO C
programs, write <code>__typeof__</code> instead of <code>typeof</code>. 
See <a href="#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

   <p>A <code>typeof</code>-construct can be used anywhere a typedef name could be
used.  For example, you can use it in a declaration, in a cast, or inside
of <code>sizeof</code> or <code>typeof</code>.

   <p><code>typeof</code> is often useful in conjunction with the
statements-within-expressions feature.  Here is how the two together can
be used to define a safe &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; macro that operates on any
arithmetic type and evaluates each of its arguments exactly once:

<pre class="example">     #define max(a,b) \
       ({ typeof (a) _a = (a); \
           typeof (b) _b = (b); \
         _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-underscores-in-variables-in-macros-1506"></a><a name="index-_0040samp_007b_005f_007d-in-variables-in-macros-1507"></a><a name="index-local-variables-in-macros-1508"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-local_002c-in-macros-1509"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-local-variables-in-1510"></a>
The reason for using names that start with underscores for the local
variables is to avoid conflicts with variable names that occur within the
expressions that are substituted for <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.  Eventually we
hope to design a new form of declaration syntax that allows you to declare
variables whose scopes start only after their initializers; this will be a
more reliable way to prevent such conflicts.

<p class="noindent">Some more examples of the use of <code>typeof</code>:

     <ul>
<li>This declares <code>y</code> with the type of what <code>x</code> points to.

     <pre class="example">          typeof (*x) y;
     </pre>
     <li>This declares <code>y</code> as an array of such values.

     <pre class="example">          typeof (*x) y[4];
     </pre>
     <li>This declares <code>y</code> as an array of pointers to characters:

     <pre class="example">          typeof (typeof (char *)[4]) y;
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">It is equivalent to the following traditional C declaration:

     <pre class="example">          char *y[4];
     </pre>
     <p>To see the meaning of the declaration using <code>typeof</code>, and why it
might be a useful way to write, let's rewrite it with these macros:

     <pre class="example">          #define pointer(T)  typeof(T *)
          #define array(T, N) typeof(T [N])
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Now the declaration can be rewritten this way:

     <pre class="example">          array (pointer (char), 4) y;
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Thus, <code>array (pointer (char), 4)</code> is the type of arrays of 4
pointers to <code>char</code>. 
</ul>

   <p><em>Compatibility Note:</em> In addition to <code>typeof</code>, GCC 2 supported
a more limited extension which permitted one to write

<pre class="example">     typedef <var>T</var> = <var>expr</var>;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">with the effect of declaring <var>T</var> to have the type of the expression
<var>expr</var>.  This extension does not work with GCC 3 (versions between
3.0 and 3.2 will crash; 3.2.1 and later give an error).  Code which
relies on it should be rewritten to use <code>typeof</code>:

<pre class="example">     typedef typeof(<var>expr</var>) <var>T</var>;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will work with all versions of GCC.

Compound expressions, conditional expressions and casts are allowed as
lvalues provided their operands are lvalues.  This means that you can take
their addresses or store values into them.

   <p>All these extensions are deprecated.

   <p>For example, a compound expression can be assigned, provided the last
expression in the sequence is an lvalue.  These two expressions are
equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (a, b) += 5
     a, (b += 5)
</pre>
   <p>Similarly, the address of the compound expression can be taken.  These two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     &amp;(a, b)
     a, &amp;b
</pre>
   <p>A conditional expression is a valid lvalue if its type is not void and the
true and false branches are both valid lvalues.  For example, these two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (a ? b : c) = 5
     (a ? b = 5 : (c = 5))
</pre>
   <p>A cast is a valid lvalue if its operand is an lvalue.  A simple
assignment whose left-hand side is a cast works by converting the
right-hand side first to the specified type, then to the type of the
inner left-hand side expression.  After this is stored, the value is
converted back to the specified type to become the value of the
assignment.  Thus, if <code>a</code> has type <code>char *</code>, the following two
expressions are equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (int)a = 5
     (int)(a = (char *)(int)5)
</pre>
   <p>An assignment-with-arithmetic operation such as <span class="samp">+=</span> applied to a cast
performs the arithmetic using the type resulting from the cast, and then
continues as in the previous case.  Therefore, these two expressions are
equivalent:

<pre class="example">     (int)a += 5
     (int)(a = (char *)(int) ((int)a + 5))
</pre>
   <p>You cannot take the address of an lvalue cast, because the use of its
address would not work out coherently.  Suppose that <code>&amp;(int)f</code> were
permitted, where <code>f</code> has type <code>float</code>.  Then the following
statement would try to store an integer bit-pattern where a floating
point number belongs:

<pre class="example">     *&amp;(int)f = 1;
</pre>
   <p>This is quite different from what <code>(int)f = 1</code> would do&mdash;that
would convert 1 to floating point and store it.  Rather than cause this
inconsistency, we think it is better to prohibit use of <span class="samp">&amp;</span> on a cast.

   <p>If you really do want an <code>int *</code> pointer with the address of
<code>f</code>, you can simply write <code>(int *)&amp;f</code>.

The middle operand in a conditional expression may be omitted.  Then
if the first operand is nonzero, its value is the value of the conditional
expression.

   <p>Therefore, the expression

<pre class="example">     x ? : y
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">has the value of <code>x</code> if that is nonzero; otherwise, the value of
<code>y</code>.

   <p>This example is perfectly equivalent to

<pre class="example">     x ? x : y
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-side-effect-in-_003f_003a-1525"></a><a name="index-_003f_003a-side-effect-1526"></a>In this simple case, the ability to omit the middle operand is not
especially useful.  When it becomes useful is when the first operand does,
or may (if it is a macro argument), contain a side effect.  Then repeating
the operand in the middle would perform the side effect twice.  Omitting
the middle operand uses the value already computed without the undesirable
effects of recomputing it.

ISO C99 supports data types for integers that are at least 64 bits wide,
and as an extension GCC supports them in C89 mode and in C++. 
Simply write <code>long long int</code> for a signed integer, or
<code>unsigned long long int</code> for an unsigned integer.  To make an
integer constant of type <code>long long int</code>, add the suffix <span class="samp">LL</span>
to the integer.  To make an integer constant of type <code>unsigned long
long int</code>, add the suffix <span class="samp">ULL</span> to the integer.

   <p>You can use these types in arithmetic like any other integer types. 
Addition, subtraction, and bitwise boolean operations on these types
are open-coded on all types of machines.  Multiplication is open-coded
if the machine supports fullword-to-doubleword a widening multiply
instruction.  Division and shifts are open-coded only on machines that
provide special support.  The operations that are not open-coded use
special library routines that come with GCC.

   <p>There may be pitfalls when you use <code>long long</code> types for function
arguments, unless you declare function prototypes.  If a function
expects type <code>int</code> for its argument, and you pass a value of type
<code>long long int</code>, confusion will result because the caller and the
subroutine will disagree about the number of bytes for the argument. 
Likewise, if the function expects <code>long long int</code> and you pass
<code>int</code>.  The best way to avoid such problems is to use prototypes.

ISO C99 supports complex floating data types, and as an extension GCC
supports them in C89 mode and in C++, and supports complex integer data
types which are not part of ISO C99.  You can declare complex types
using the keyword <code>_Complex</code>.  As an extension, the older GNU
keyword <code>__complex__</code> is also supported.

   <p>For example, <span class="samp">_Complex double x;</span> declares <code>x</code> as a
variable whose real part and imaginary part are both of type
<code>double</code>.  <span class="samp">_Complex short int y;</span> declares <code>y</code> to
have real and imaginary parts of type <code>short int</code>; this is not
likely to be useful, but it shows that the set of complex types is
complete.

   <p>To write a constant with a complex data type, use the suffix <span class="samp">i</span> or
<span class="samp">j</span> (either one; they are equivalent).  For example, <code>2.5fi</code>
has type <code>_Complex float</code> and <code>3i</code> has type
<code>_Complex int</code>.  Such a constant always has a pure imaginary
value, but you can form any complex value you like by adding one to a
real constant.  This is a GNU extension; if you have an ISO C99
conforming C library (such as GNU libc), and want to construct complex
constants of floating type, you should include <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> and
use the macros <code>I</code> or <code>_Complex_I</code> instead.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005f_005freal_005f_005f_007d-keyword-1535"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005f_005fimag_005f_005f_007d-keyword-1536"></a>To extract the real part of a complex-valued expression <var>exp</var>, write
<code>__real__ </code><var>exp</var>.  Likewise, use <code>__imag__</code> to
extract the imaginary part.  This is a GNU extension; for values of
floating type, you should use the ISO C99 functions <code>crealf</code>,
<code>creal</code>, <code>creall</code>, <code>cimagf</code>, <code>cimag</code> and
<code>cimagl</code>, declared in <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> and also provided as
built-in functions by GCC.

   <p><a name="index-complex-conjugation-1537"></a>The operator <span class="samp">~</span> performs complex conjugation when used on a value
with a complex type.  This is a GNU extension; for values of
floating type, you should use the ISO C99 functions <code>conjf</code>,
<code>conj</code> and <code>conjl</code>, declared in <code>&lt;complex.h&gt;</code> and also
provided as built-in functions by GCC.

   <p>GCC can allocate complex automatic variables in a noncontiguous
fashion; it's even possible for the real part to be in a register while
the imaginary part is on the stack (or vice-versa).  Only the DWARF2
debug info format can represent this, so use of DWARF2 is recommended. 
If you are using the stabs debug info format, GCC describes a noncontiguous
complex variable as if it were two separate variables of noncomplex type. 
If the variable's actual name is <code>foo</code>, the two fictitious
variables are named <code>foo$real</code> and <code>foo$imag</code>.  You can
examine and set these two fictitious variables with your debugger.

<h3 class="section">5.11 Hex Floats</h3>

<p><a name="index-hex-floats-1538"></a>
ISO C99 supports floating-point numbers written not only in the usual
decimal notation, such as <code>1.55e1</code>, but also numbers such as
<code>0x1.fp3</code> written in hexadecimal format.  As a GNU extension, GCC
supports this in C89 mode (except in some cases when strictly
conforming) and in C++.  In that format the
<span class="samp">0x</span> hex introducer and the <span class="samp">p</span> or <span class="samp">P</span> exponent field are
mandatory.  The exponent is a decimal number that indicates the power of
2 by which the significant part will be multiplied.  Thus <span class="samp">0x1.f</span> is
1 15/16,
<span class="samp">p3</span> multiplies it by 8, and the value of <code>0x1.fp3</code>
is the same as <code>1.55e1</code>.

   <p>Unlike for floating-point numbers in the decimal notation the exponent
is always required in the hexadecimal notation.  Otherwise the compiler
would not be able to resolve the ambiguity of, e.g., <code>0x1.f</code>.  This
could mean <code>1.0f</code> or <code>1.9375</code> since <span class="samp">f</span> is also the
extension for floating-point constants of type <code>float</code>.

<h3 class="section">5.12 Arrays of Length Zero</h3>

<p><a name="index-arrays-of-length-zero-1539"></a><a name="index-zero_002dlength-arrays-1540"></a><a name="index-length_002dzero-arrays-1541"></a><a name="index-flexible-array-members-1542"></a>
Zero-length arrays are allowed in GNU C.  They are very useful as the
last element of a structure which is really a header for a variable-length
object:

<pre class="example">     struct line {
       int length;
       char contents[0];
     };
     
     struct line *thisline = (struct line *)
       malloc (sizeof (struct line) + this_length);
     thisline-&gt;length = this_length;
</pre>
   <p>In ISO C90, you would have to give <code>contents</code> a length of 1, which
means either you waste space or complicate the argument to <code>malloc</code>.

   <p>In ISO C99, you would use a <dfn>flexible array member</dfn>, which is
slightly different in syntax and semantics:

     <ul>
<li>Flexible array members are written as <code>contents[]</code> without
the <code>0</code>.

     <li>Flexible array members have incomplete type, and so the <code>sizeof</code>
operator may not be applied.  As a quirk of the original implementation
of zero-length arrays, <code>sizeof</code> evaluates to zero.

     <li>Flexible array members may only appear as the last member of a
<code>struct</code> that is otherwise non-empty.

     <li>A structure containing a flexible array member, or a union containing
such a structure (possibly recursively), may not be a member of a
structure or an element of an array.  (However, these uses are
permitted by GCC as extensions.) 
</ul>

   <p>GCC versions before 3.0 allowed zero-length arrays to be statically
initialized, as if they were flexible arrays.  In addition to those
cases that were useful, it also allowed initializations in situations
that would corrupt later data.  Non-empty initialization of zero-length
arrays is now treated like any case where there are more initializer
elements than the array holds, in that a suitable warning about "excess
elements in array" is given, and the excess elements (all of them, in
this case) are ignored.

   <p>Instead GCC allows static initialization of flexible array members. 
This is equivalent to defining a new structure containing the original
structure followed by an array of sufficient size to contain the data. 
I.e. in the following, <code>f1</code> is constructed as if it were declared
like <code>f2</code>.

<pre class="example">     struct f1 {
       int x; int y[];
     } f1 = { 1, { 2, 3, 4 } };
     
     struct f2 {
       struct f1 f1; int data[3];
     } f2 = { { 1 }, { 2, 3, 4 } };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The convenience of this extension is that <code>f1</code> has the desired
type, eliminating the need to consistently refer to <code>f2.f1</code>.

   <p>This has symmetry with normal static arrays, in that an array of
unknown size is also written with <code>[]</code>.

   <p>Of course, this extension only makes sense if the extra data comes at
the end of a top-level object, as otherwise we would be overwriting
data at subsequent offsets.  To avoid undue complication and confusion
with initialization of deeply nested arrays, we simply disallow any
non-empty initialization except when the structure is the top-level
object.  For example:

<pre class="example">     struct foo { int x; int y[]; };

GCC permits a C structure to have no members:

<pre class="example">     struct empty {
     };
</pre>
   <p>The structure will have size zero.  In C++, empty structures are part
of the language.  G++ treats empty structures as if they had a single

<p><a name="index-variable_002dlength-arrays-1545"></a><a name="index-arrays-of-variable-length-1546"></a><a name="index-VLAs-1547"></a>
Variable-length automatic arrays are allowed in ISO C99, and as an
extension GCC accepts them in C89 mode and in C++.  (However, GCC's
implementation of variable-length arrays does not yet conform in detail
to the ISO C99 standard.)  These arrays are
declared like any other automatic arrays, but with a length that is not
a constant expression.  The storage is allocated at the point of
declaration and deallocated when the brace-level is exited.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     FILE *
     concat_fopen (char *s1, char *s2, char *mode)
     {
       char str[strlen (s1) + strlen (s2) + 1];
       strcpy (str, s1);
       strcat (str, s2);
       return fopen (str, mode);
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-scope-of-a-variable-length-array-1548"></a><a name="index-variable_002dlength-array-scope-1549"></a><a name="index-deallocating-variable-length-arrays-1550"></a>Jumping or breaking out of the scope of the array name deallocates the
storage.  Jumping into the scope is not allowed; you get an error
message for it.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007balloca_007d-vs-variable_002dlength-arrays-1551"></a>You can use the function <code>alloca</code> to get an effect much like
variable-length arrays.  The function <code>alloca</code> is available in
many other C implementations (but not in all).  On the other hand,
variable-length arrays are more elegant.

   <p>There are other differences between these two methods.  Space allocated
with <code>alloca</code> exists until the containing <em>function</em> returns. 
The space for a variable-length array is deallocated as soon as the array
name's scope ends.  (If you use both variable-length arrays and
<code>alloca</code> in the same function, deallocation of a variable-length array
will also deallocate anything more recently allocated with <code>alloca</code>.)

   <p>You can also use variable-length arrays as arguments to functions:

<pre class="example">     struct entry
     tester (int len, char data[len][len])
     {
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
   <p>The length of an array is computed once when the storage is allocated
and is remembered for the scope of the array in case you access it with
<code>sizeof</code>.

   <p>If you want to pass the array first and the length afterward, you can
use a forward declaration in the parameter list&mdash;another GNU extension.

<pre class="example">     struct entry
     tester (int len; char data[len][len], int len)
     {
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-parameter-forward-declaration-1552"></a>The <span class="samp">int len</span> before the semicolon is a <dfn>parameter forward
declaration</dfn>, and it serves the purpose of making the name <code>len</code>
known when the declaration of <code>data</code> is parsed.

   <p>You can write any number of such parameter forward declarations in the
parameter list.  They can be separated by commas or semicolons, but the
last one must end with a semicolon, which is followed by the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
parameter declarations.  Each forward declaration must match a &ldquo;real&rdquo;
declaration in parameter name and data type.  ISO C99 does not support
parameter forward declarations.

<h3 class="section">5.15 Macros with a Variable Number of Arguments.</h3>

<p><a name="index-variable-number-of-arguments-1553"></a><a name="index-macro-with-variable-arguments-1554"></a><a name="index-rest-argument-_0028in-macro_0029-1555"></a><a name="index-variadic-macros-1556"></a>
In the ISO C standard of 1999, a macro can be declared to accept a
variable number of arguments much as a function can.  The syntax for
defining the macro is similar to that of a function.  Here is an
example:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define debug(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, __VA_ARGS__)
</pre>
   <p>Here <span class="samp">...</span> is a <dfn>variable argument</dfn>.  In the invocation of
such a macro, it represents the zero or more tokens until the closing
parenthesis that ends the invocation, including any commas.  This set of
tokens replaces the identifier <code>__VA_ARGS__</code> in the macro body
wherever it appears.  See the CPP manual for more information.

   <p>GCC has long supported variadic macros, and used a different syntax that
allowed you to give a name to the variable arguments just like any other
argument.  Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     #define debug(format, args...) fprintf (stderr, format, args)
</pre>
   <p>This is in all ways equivalent to the ISO C example above, but arguably
more readable and descriptive.

   <p>GNU CPP has two further variadic macro extensions, and permits them to
be used with either of the above forms of macro definition.

   <p>In standard C, you are not allowed to leave the variable argument out
entirely; but you are allowed to pass an empty argument.  For example,
this invocation is invalid in ISO C, because there is no comma after
the string:

<pre class="example">     debug ("A message")
</pre>
   <p>GNU CPP permits you to completely omit the variable arguments in this
way.  In the above examples, the compiler would complain, though since
the expansion of the macro still has the extra comma after the format
string.

   <p>To help solve this problem, CPP behaves specially for variable arguments
used with the token paste operator, <span class="samp">##</span>.  If instead you write

<pre class="smallexample">     #define debug(format, ...) fprintf (stderr, format, ## __VA_ARGS__)
</pre>
   <p>and if the variable arguments are omitted or empty, the <span class="samp">##</span>
operator causes the preprocessor to remove the comma before it.  If you
do provide some variable arguments in your macro invocation, GNU CPP
does not complain about the paste operation and instead places the
variable arguments after the comma.  Just like any other pasted macro
argument, these arguments are not macro expanded.

<p><a name="index-escaped-newlines-1557"></a><a name="index-newlines-_0028escaped_0029-1558"></a>
Recently, the preprocessor has relaxed its treatment of escaped
newlines.  Previously, the newline had to immediately follow a
backslash.  The current implementation allows whitespace in the form
of spaces, horizontal and vertical tabs, and form feeds between the
backslash and the subsequent newline.  The preprocessor issues a
warning, but treats it as a valid escaped newline and combines the two
lines to form a single logical line.  This works within comments and
tokens, as well as between tokens.  Comments are <em>not</em> treated as
whitespace for the purposes of this relaxation, since they have not
yet been replaced with spaces.

As in standard C++ and ISO C99, the elements of an aggregate initializer for an

Here is an example of an initializer with run-time varying elements:

<pre class="example">     foo (float f, float g)

   <p>ISO C99 supports compound literals.  A compound literal looks like
a cast containing an initializer.  Its value is an object of the
type specified in the cast, containing the elements specified in
the initializer; it is an lvalue.  As an extension, GCC supports
compound literals in C89 mode and in C++.

   <p>Usually, the specified type is a structure.  Assume that
<code>struct foo</code> and <code>structure</code> are declared as shown:

<pre class="example">     struct foo {int a; char b[2];} structure;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here is an example of constructing a <code>struct foo</code> with a compound literal:

<pre class="example">     structure = ((struct foo) {x + y, 'a', 0});
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is equivalent to writing the following:

<pre class="example">     {
       struct foo temp = {x + y, 'a', 0};
       structure = temp;
     }
</pre>
   <p>You can also construct an array.  If all the elements of the compound literal
are (made up of) simple constant expressions, suitable for use in
initializers of objects of static storage duration, then the compound
literal can be coerced to a pointer to its first element and used in
such an initializer, as shown here:

<pre class="example">     char **foo = (char *[]) { "x", "y", "z" };
</pre>
   <p>Compound literals for scalar types and union types are is
also allowed, but then the compound literal is equivalent
to a cast.

   <p>As a GNU extension, GCC allows initialization of objects with static storage
duration by compound literals (which is not possible in ISO C99, because
the initializer is not a constant). 
It is handled as if the object was initialized only with the bracket
enclosed list if compound literal's and object types match. 
The initializer list of the compound literal must be constant. 
If the object being initialized has array type of unknown size, the size is
determined by compound literal size.

<pre class="example">     static struct foo x = (struct foo) {1, 'a', 'b'};
     static int y[] = (int []) {1, 2, 3};
     static int z[] = (int [3]) {1};
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The above lines are equivalent to the following:
<pre class="example">     static struct foo x = {1, 'a', 'b'};
     static int y[] = {1, 2, 3};
     static int z[] = {1, 0, 0};

Standard C89 requires the elements of an initializer to appear in a fixed
order, the same as the order of the elements in the array or structure
being initialized.

   <p>In ISO C99 you can give the elements in any order, specifying the array
indices or structure field names they apply to, and GNU C allows this as
an extension in C89 mode as well.  This extension is not
implemented in GNU C++.

   <p>To specify an array index, write
<span class="samp">[</span><var>index</var><span class="samp">] =</span> before the element value.  For example,

<pre class="example">     int a[6] = { [4] = 29, [2] = 15 };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is equivalent to

<pre class="example">     int a[6] = { 0, 0, 15, 0, 29, 0 };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The index values must be constant expressions, even if the array being
initialized is automatic.

   <p>An alternative syntax for this which has been obsolete since GCC 2.5 but
GCC still accepts is to write <span class="samp">[</span><var>index</var><span class="samp">]</span> before the element
value, with no <span class="samp">=</span>.

   <p>To initialize a range of elements to the same value, write
<span class="samp">[</span><var>first</var><span class="samp"> ... </span><var>last</var><span class="samp">] = </span><var>value</var>.  This is a GNU
extension.  For example,

<pre class="example">     int widths[] = { [0 ... 9] = 1, [10 ... 99] = 2, [100] = 3 };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the value in it has side-effects, the side-effects will happen only once,
not for each initialized field by the range initializer.

<p class="noindent">Note that the length of the array is the highest value specified
plus one.

   <p>In a structure initializer, specify the name of a field to initialize
with <span class="samp">.</span><var>fieldname</var><span class="samp"> =</span> before the element value.  For example,
given the following structure,

<pre class="example">     struct point { int x, y; };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the following initialization

<pre class="example">     struct point p = { .y = yvalue, .x = xvalue };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is equivalent to

<pre class="example">     struct point p = { xvalue, yvalue };
</pre>
   <p>Another syntax which has the same meaning, obsolete since GCC 2.5, is
<var>fieldname</var><span class="samp">:</span>, as shown here:

<pre class="example">     struct point p = { y: yvalue, x: xvalue };
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-designators-1578"></a>The <span class="samp">[</span><var>index</var><span class="samp">]</span> or <span class="samp">.</span><var>fieldname</var> is known as a
<dfn>designator</dfn>.  You can also use a designator (or the obsolete colon
syntax) when initializing a union, to specify which element of the union
should be used.  For example,

<pre class="example">     union foo { int i; double d; };
     
     union foo f = { .d = 4 };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will convert 4 to a <code>double</code> to store it in the union using
the second element.  By contrast, casting 4 to type <code>union foo</code>
would store it into the union as the integer <code>i</code>, since it is
an integer.  (See <a href="#Cast-to-Union">Cast to Union</a>.)

   <p>You can combine this technique of naming elements with ordinary C
initialization of successive elements.  Each initializer element that
does not have a designator applies to the next consecutive element of the
array or structure.  For example,

<pre class="example">     int a[6] = { [1] = v1, v2, [4] = v4 };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is equivalent to

<pre class="example">     int a[6] = { 0, v1, v2, 0, v4, 0 };
</pre>
   <p>Labeling the elements of an array initializer is especially useful
when the indices are characters or belong to an <code>enum</code> type. 
For example:

<pre class="example">     int whitespace[256]
       = { [' '] = 1, ['\t'] = 1, ['\h'] = 1,
           ['\f'] = 1, ['\n'] = 1, ['\r'] = 1 };
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-designator-lists-1579"></a>You can also write a series of <span class="samp">.</span><var>fieldname</var> and
<span class="samp">[</span><var>index</var><span class="samp">]</span> designators before an <span class="samp">=</span> to specify a
nested subobject to initialize; the list is taken relative to the
subobject corresponding to the closest surrounding brace pair.  For
example, with the <span class="samp">struct point</span> declaration above:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct point ptarray[10] = { [2].y = yv2, [2].x = xv2, [0].x = xv0 };
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the same field is initialized multiple times, it will have value from
the last initialization.  If any such overridden initialization has
side-effect, it is unspecified whether the side-effect happens or not. 
Currently, gcc will discard them and issue a warning.

<h3 class="section">5.22 Case Ranges</h3>

<p><a name="index-case-ranges-1580"></a><a name="index-ranges-in-case-statements-1581"></a>
You can specify a range of consecutive values in a single <code>case</code> label,
like this:

<pre class="example">     case <var>low</var> ... <var>high</var>:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This has the same effect as the proper number of individual <code>case</code>
labels, one for each integer value from <var>low</var> to <var>high</var>, inclusive.

   <p>This feature is especially useful for ranges of ASCII character codes:

<pre class="example">     case 'A' ... 'Z':
</pre>
   <p><strong>Be careful:</strong> Write spaces around the <code>...</code>, for otherwise
it may be parsed wrong when you use it with integer values.  For example,
write this:

<pre class="example">     case 1 ... 5:

<p><a name="index-cast-to-a-union-1582"></a><a name="index-union_002c-casting-to-a-1583"></a>
A cast to union type is similar to other casts, except that the type
specified is a union type.  You can specify the type either with
<code>union </code><var>tag</var> or with a typedef name.  A cast to union is actually
a constructor though, not a cast, and hence does not yield an lvalue like
normal casts.  (See <a href="#Compound-Literals">Compound Literals</a>.)

   <p>The types that may be cast to the union type are those of the members
of the union.  Thus, given the following union and variables:

<pre class="example">     union foo { int i; double d; };
     int x;
     double y;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> can be cast to type <code>union foo</code>.

   <p>Using the cast as the right-hand side of an assignment to a variable of
union type is equivalent to storing in a member of the union:

<pre class="example">     union foo u;
     /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     u = (union foo) x  ==  u.i = x
     u = (union foo) y  ==  u.d = y
</pre>
   <p>You can also use the union cast as a function argument:

<pre class="example">     void hack (union foo);
     /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     hack ((union foo) x);

ISO C99 and ISO C++ allow declarations and code to be freely mixed

In GNU C, you declare certain things about functions called in your program
which help the compiler optimize function calls and check your code more
carefully.

   <p>The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes when making a declaration.  This keyword is followed by an
attribute specification inside double parentheses.  The following
attributes are currently defined for functions on all targets:
<code>noreturn</code>, <code>noinline</code>, <code>always_inline</code>,
<code>pure</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>nothrow</code>,
<code>format</code>, <code>format_arg</code>, <code>no_instrument_function</code>,
<code>section</code>, <code>constructor</code>, <code>destructor</code>, <code>used</code>,
<code>unused</code>, <code>deprecated</code>, <code>weak</code>, <code>malloc</code>,
<code>alias</code>, and <code>nonnull</code>.  Several other attributes are defined
for functions on particular target systems.  Other attributes, including
<code>section</code> are supported for variables declarations
(see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>) and for types (see <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>).

   <p>You may also specify attributes with <span class="samp">__</span> preceding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use <code>__noreturn__</code> instead of <code>noreturn</code>.

   <p>See <a href="#Attribute-Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.

     
<a name="index-_0040code_007bnoreturn_007d-function-attribute-1600"></a>
<dl><dt><code>noreturn</code><dd>A few standard library functions, such as <code>abort</code> and <code>exit</code>,
cannot return.  GCC knows this automatically.  Some programs define
their own functions that never return.  You can declare them
<code>noreturn</code> to tell the compiler this fact.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          void fatal () __attribute__ ((noreturn));
          
          void
          fatal (/* <span class="roman">...</span> */)
          {
            /* <span class="roman">...</span> */ /* <span class="roman">Print error message.</span> */ /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
            exit (1);
          }
     </pre>
     <p>The <code>noreturn</code> keyword tells the compiler to assume that
<code>fatal</code> cannot return.  It can then optimize without regard to what
would happen if <code>fatal</code> ever did return.  This makes slightly
better code.  More importantly, it helps avoid spurious warnings of
uninitialized variables.

     <p>Do not assume that registers saved by the calling function are
restored before calling the <code>noreturn</code> function.

     <p>It does not make sense for a <code>noreturn</code> function to have a return
type other than <code>void</code>.

     <p>The attribute <code>noreturn</code> is not implemented in GCC versions
earlier than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function does
not return, which works in the current version and in some older
versions, is as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef void voidfn ();
          
          volatile voidfn fatal;
     </pre>
     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bnoinline_007d-function-attribute-1601"></a><br><dt><code>noinline</code><dd>This function attribute prevents a function from being considered for
inlining.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007balways_005finline_007d-function-attribute-1602"></a><br><dt><code>always_inline</code><dd>Generally, functions are not inlined unless optimization is specified. 
For functions declared inline, this attribute inlines the function even
if no optimization level was specified.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bpure_007d-function-attribute-1603"></a><br><dt><code>pure</code><dd>Many functions have no effects except the return value and their
return value depends only on the parameters and/or global variables. 
Such a function can be subject
to common subexpression elimination and loop optimization just as an
arithmetic operator would be.  These functions should be declared
with the attribute <code>pure</code>.  For example,

     <pre class="smallexample">          int square (int) __attribute__ ((pure));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">says that the hypothetical function <code>square</code> is safe to call
fewer times than the program says.

     <p>Some of common examples of pure functions are <code>strlen</code> or <code>memcmp</code>. 
Interesting non-pure functions are functions with infinite loops or those
depending on volatile memory or other system resource, that may change between
two consecutive calls (such as <code>feof</code> in a multithreading environment).

     <p>The attribute <code>pure</code> is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
than 2.96. 
<a name="index-_0040code_007bconst_007d-function-attribute-1604"></a><br><dt><code>const</code><dd>Many functions do not examine any values except their arguments, and
have no effects except the return value.  Basically this is just slightly
more strict class than the <code>pure</code> attribute above, since function is not
allowed to read global memory.

     <p><a name="index-pointer-arguments-1605"></a>Note that a function that has pointer arguments and examines the data
pointed to must <em>not</em> be declared <code>const</code>.  Likewise, a
function that calls a non-<code>const</code> function usually must not be
<code>const</code>.  It does not make sense for a <code>const</code> function to
return <code>void</code>.

     <p>The attribute <code>const</code> is not implemented in GCC versions earlier
than 2.5.  An alternative way to declare that a function has no side
effects, which works in the current version and in some older versions,
is as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int intfn ();
          
          extern const intfn square;
     </pre>
     <p>This approach does not work in GNU C++ from 2.6.0 on, since the language
specifies that the <span class="samp">const</span> must be attached to the return value.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bnothrow_007d-function-attribute-1606"></a><br><dt><code>nothrow</code><dd>The <code>nothrow</code> attribute is used to inform the compiler that a
function cannot throw an exception.  For example, most functions in
the standard C library can be guaranteed not to throw an exception
with the notable exceptions of <code>qsort</code> and <code>bsearch</code> that
take function pointer arguments.  The <code>nothrow</code> attribute is not
implemented in GCC versions earlier than 3.2.

     <br><dt><code>format (</code><var>archetype</var><code>, </code><var>string-index</var><code>, </code><var>first-to-check</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bformat_007d-function-attribute-1607"></a><a name="index-Wformat-1608"></a>The <code>format</code> attribute specifies that a function takes <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> style arguments which
should be type-checked against a format string.  For example, the
declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern int
          my_printf (void *my_object, const char *my_format, ...)
                __attribute__ ((format (printf, 2, 3)));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to <code>my_printf</code>
for consistency with the <code>printf</code> style format string argument
<code>my_format</code>.

     <p>The parameter <var>archetype</var> determines how the format string is
interpreted, and should be <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code>
or <code>strfmon</code>.  (You can also use <code>__printf__</code>,
<code>__scanf__</code>, <code>__strftime__</code> or <code>__strfmon__</code>.)  The
parameter <var>string-index</var> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from 1), while <var>first-to-check</var> is the
number of the first argument to check against the format string.  For
functions where the arguments are not available to be checked (such as
<code>vprintf</code>), specify the third parameter as zero.  In this case the
compiler only checks the format string for consistency.  For
<code>strftime</code> formats, the third parameter is required to be zero. 
Since non-static C++ methods have an implicit <code>this</code> argument, the
arguments of such methods should be counted from two, not one, when
giving values for <var>string-index</var> and <var>first-to-check</var>.

     <p>In the example above, the format string (<code>my_format</code>) is the second
argument of the function <code>my_print</code>, and the arguments to check
start with the third argument, so the correct parameters for the format
attribute are 2 and 3.

     <p><a name="index-ffreestanding-1609"></a>The <code>format</code> attribute allows you to identify your own functions
which take format strings as arguments, so that GCC can check the
calls to these functions for errors.  The compiler always (unless
<span class="option">-ffreestanding</span> is used) checks formats
for the standard library functions <code>printf</code>, <code>fprintf</code>,
<code>sprintf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>fscanf</code>, <code>sscanf</code>, <code>strftime</code>,
<code>vprintf</code>, <code>vfprintf</code> and <code>vsprintf</code> whenever such
warnings are requested (using <span class="option">-Wformat</span>), so there is no need to
modify the header file <span class="file">stdio.h</span>.  In C99 mode, the functions
<code>snprintf</code>, <code>vsnprintf</code>, <code>vscanf</code>, <code>vfscanf</code> and
<code>vsscanf</code> are also checked.  Except in strictly conforming C
standard modes, the X/Open function <code>strfmon</code> is also checked as
are <code>printf_unlocked</code> and <code>fprintf_unlocked</code>. 
See <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

     <br><dt><code>format_arg (</code><var>string-index</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bformat_005farg_007d-function-attribute-1610"></a><a name="index-Wformat_002dnonliteral-1611"></a>The <code>format_arg</code> attribute specifies that a function takes a format
string for a <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or
<code>strfmon</code> style function and modifies it (for example, to translate
it into another language), so the result can be passed to a
<code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> style
function (with the remaining arguments to the format function the same
as they would have been for the unmodified string).  For example, the
declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern char *
          my_dgettext (char *my_domain, const char *my_format)
                __attribute__ ((format_arg (2)));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to check the arguments in calls to a <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code> type function, whose
format string argument is a call to the <code>my_dgettext</code> function, for
consistency with the format string argument <code>my_format</code>.  If the
<code>format_arg</code> attribute had not been specified, all the compiler
could tell in such calls to format functions would be that the format
string argument is not constant; this would generate a warning when
<span class="option">-Wformat-nonliteral</span> is used, but the calls could not be checked
without the attribute.

     <p>The parameter <var>string-index</var> specifies which argument is the format
string argument (starting from one).  Since non-static C++ methods have
an implicit <code>this</code> argument, the arguments of such methods should
be counted from two.

     <p>The <code>format-arg</code> attribute allows you to identify your own
functions which modify format strings, so that GCC can check the
calls to <code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> or <code>strfmon</code>
type function whose operands are a call to one of your own function. 
The compiler always treats <code>gettext</code>, <code>dgettext</code>, and
<code>dcgettext</code> in this manner except when strict ISO C support is
requested by <span class="option">-ansi</span> or an appropriate <span class="option">-std</span> option, or
<span class="option">-ffreestanding</span> is used.  See <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

     <br><dt><code>nonnull (</code><var>arg-index</var><code>, ...)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bnonnull_007d-function-attribute-1612"></a>The <code>nonnull</code> attribute specifies that some function parameters should
be non-null pointers.  For instance, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
          	__attribute__((nonnull (1, 2)));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to check that, in calls to <code>my_memcpy</code>,
arguments <var>dest</var> and <var>src</var> are non-null.  If the compiler
determines that a null pointer is passed in an argument slot marked
as non-null, and the <span class="option">-Wnonnull</span> option is enabled, a warning
is issued.  The compiler may also choose to make optimizations based
on the knowledge that certain function arguments will not be null.

     <p>If no argument index list is given to the <code>nonnull</code> attribute,
all pointer arguments are marked as non-null.  To illustrate, the
following declaration is equivalent to the previous example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void *
          my_memcpy (void *dest, const void *src, size_t len)
          	__attribute__((nonnull));
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>no_instrument_function</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bno_005finstrument_005ffunction_007d-function-attribute-1613"></a><a name="index-finstrument_002dfunctions-1614"></a>If <span class="option">-finstrument-functions</span> is given, profiling function calls will
be generated at entry and exit of most user-compiled functions. 
Functions with this attribute will not be so instrumented.

     <br><dt><code>section ("</code><var>section-name</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bsection_007d-function-attribute-1615"></a>Normally, the compiler places the code it generates in the <code>text</code> section. 
Sometimes, however, you need additional sections, or you need certain
particular functions to appear in special sections.  The <code>section</code>
attribute specifies that a function lives in a particular section. 
For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern void foobar (void) __attribute__ ((section ("bar")));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">puts the function <code>foobar</code> in the <code>bar</code> section.

     <p>Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <code>section</code>
attribute is not available on all platforms. 
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

     <br><dt><code>constructor</code><dt><code>destructor</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bconstructor_007d-function-attribute-1616"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bdestructor_007d-function-attribute-1617"></a>The <code>constructor</code> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically before execution enters <code>main ()</code>.  Similarly, the
<code>destructor</code> attribute causes the function to be called
automatically after <code>main ()</code> has completed or <code>exit ()</code> has
been called.  Functions with these attributes are useful for
initializing data that will be used implicitly during the execution of
the program.

     <p>These attributes are not currently implemented for Objective-C.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bunused_007d-attribute_002e-1618"></a><br><dt><code>unused</code><dd>This attribute, attached to a function, means that the function is meant
to be possibly unused.  GCC will not produce a warning for this
function.  GNU C++ does not currently support this attribute as
definitions without parameters are valid in C++.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bused_007d-attribute_002e-1619"></a><br><dt><code>used</code><dd>This attribute, attached to a function, means that code must be emitted
for the function even if it appears that the function is not referenced. 
This is useful, for example, when the function is referenced only in
inline assembly.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bdeprecated_007d-attribute_002e-1620"></a><br><dt><code>deprecated</code><dd>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute results in a warning if the function
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
functions that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated function, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the function is deprecated, or what they should
do instead.  Note that the warnings only occurs for uses:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int old_fn () __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          int old_fn ();
          int (*fn_ptr)() = old_fn;
     </pre>
     <p>results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.

     <p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute can also be used for variables and
types (see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>, see <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>weak</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bweak_007d-attribute-1621"></a>The <code>weak</code> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as a weak
symbol rather than a global.  This is primarily useful in defining
library functions which can be overridden in user code, though it can
also be used with non-function declarations.  Weak symbols are supported
for ELF targets, and also for a.out targets when using the GNU assembler
and linker.

     <br><dt><code>malloc</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bmalloc_007d-attribute-1622"></a>The <code>malloc</code> attribute is used to tell the compiler that a function
may be treated as if it were the malloc function.  The compiler assumes
that calls to malloc result in pointers that cannot alias anything. 
This will often improve optimization.

     <br><dt><code>alias ("</code><var>target</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007balias_007d-attribute-1623"></a>The <code>alias</code> attribute causes the declaration to be emitted as an
alias for another symbol, which must be specified.  For instance,

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __f () { /* <span class="roman">Do something.</span> */; }
          void f () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("__f")));
     </pre>
     <p>declares <span class="samp">f</span> to be a weak alias for <span class="samp">__f</span>.  In C++, the
mangled name for the target must be used.

     <p>Not all target machines support this attribute.

     <br><dt><code>visibility ("</code><var>visibility_type</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bvisibility_007d-attribute-1624"></a>The <code>visibility</code> attribute on ELF targets causes the declaration
to be emitted with default, hidden, protected or internal visibility.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void __attribute__ ((visibility ("protected")))
          f () { /* <span class="roman">Do something.</span> */; }
          int i __attribute__ ((visibility ("hidden")));
     </pre>
     <p>See the ELF gABI for complete details, but the short story is:

          <dl>
<dt><dfn>default</dfn><dd>Default visibility is the normal case for ELF.  This value is
available for the visibility attribute to override other options
that may change the assumed visibility of symbols.

          <br><dt><dfn>hidden</dfn><dd>Hidden visibility indicates that the symbol will not be placed into
the dynamic symbol table, so no other <dfn>module</dfn> (executable or
shared library) can reference it directly.

          <br><dt><dfn>protected</dfn><dd>Protected visibility indicates that the symbol will be placed in the
dynamic symbol table, but that references within the defining module
will bind to the local symbol.  That is, the symbol cannot be overridden
by another module.

          <br><dt><dfn>internal</dfn><dd>Internal visibility is like hidden visibility, but with additional
processor specific semantics.  Unless otherwise specified by the psABI,
gcc defines internal visibility to mean that the function is <em>never</em>
called from another module.  Note that hidden symbols, while they cannot
be referenced directly by other modules, can be referenced indirectly via
function pointers.  By indicating that a symbol cannot be called from
outside the module, gcc may for instance omit the load of a PIC register
since it is known that the calling function loaded the correct value. 
</dl>

     <p>Not all ELF targets support this attribute.

     <br><dt><code>regparm (</code><var>number</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bregparm_007d-attribute-1625"></a><a name="index-functions-that-are-passed-arguments-in-registers-on-the-386-1626"></a>On the Intel 386, the <code>regparm</code> attribute causes the compiler to
pass up to <var>number</var> integer arguments in registers EAX,
EDX, and ECX instead of on the stack.  Functions that take a
variable number of arguments will continue to be passed all of their
arguments on the stack.

     <p>Beware that on some ELF systems this attribute is unsuitable for
global functions in shared libraries with lazy binding (which is the
default).  Lazy binding will send the first call via resolving code in
the loader, which might assume EAX, EDX and ECX can be clobbered, as
per the standard calling conventions.  Solaris 8 is affected by this. 
GNU systems with GLIBC 2.1 or higher, and FreeBSD, are believed to be
safe since the loaders there save all registers.  (Lazy binding can be
disabled with the linker or the loader if desired, to avoid the
problem.)

     <br><dt><code>stdcall</code><dd><a name="index-functions-that-pop-the-argument-stack-on-the-386-1627"></a>On the Intel 386, the <code>stdcall</code> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the called function will pop off the stack space used to
pass arguments, unless it takes a variable number of arguments.

     <br><dt><code>cdecl</code><dd><a name="index-functions-that-do-pop-the-argument-stack-on-the-386-1628"></a><a name="index-mrtd-1629"></a>On the Intel 386, the <code>cdecl</code> attribute causes the compiler to
assume that the calling function will pop off the stack space used to
pass arguments.  This is
useful to override the effects of the <span class="option">-mrtd</span> switch.

     <br><dt><code>longcall/shortcall</code><dd><a name="index-functions-called-via-pointer-on-the-RS_002f6000-and-PowerPC-1630"></a>On the RS/6000 and PowerPC, the <code>longcall</code> attribute causes the
compiler to always call this function via a pointer, just as it would if
the <span class="option">-mlongcall</span> option had been specified.  The <code>shortcall</code>
attribute causes the compiler not to do this.  These attributes override
both the <span class="option">-mlongcall</span> switch and the <code>#pragma longcall</code>
setting.

     <p>See <a href="#RS_002f6000-and-PowerPC-Options">RS/6000 and PowerPC Options</a>, for more information on whether long
calls are necessary.

     <br><dt><code>long_call/short_call</code><dd><a name="index-indirect-calls-on-ARM-1631"></a>This attribute specifies how a particular function is called on
ARM.  Both attributes override the <span class="option">-mlong-calls</span> (see <a href="#ARM-Options">ARM Options</a>)
command line switch and <code>#pragma long_calls</code> settings.  The
<code>long_call</code> attribute causes the compiler to always call the
function by first loading its address into a register and then using the
contents of that register.   The <code>short_call</code> attribute always places
the offset to the function from the call site into the <span class="samp">BL</span>
instruction directly.

     <br><dt><code>function_vector</code><dd><a name="index-calling-functions-through-the-function-vector-on-the-H8_002f300-processors-1632"></a>Use this attribute on the H8/300 and H8/300H to indicate that the specified
function should be called through the function vector.  Calling a
function through the function vector will reduce code size, however;
the function vector has a limited size (maximum 128 entries on the H8/300
and 64 entries on the H8/300H) and shares space with the interrupt vector.

     <p>You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this attribute to work correctly.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt</code><dd><a name="index-interrupt-handler-functions-1633"></a>Use this attribute on the ARM, AVR, M32R/D and Xstormy16 ports to indicate
that the specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will
generate function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an
interrupt handler when this attribute is present.

     <p>Note, interrupt handlers for the H8/300, H8/300H and SH processors can
be specified via the <code>interrupt_handler</code> attribute.

     <p>Note, on the AVR, interrupts will be enabled inside the function.

     <p>Note, for the ARM, you can specify the kind of interrupt to be handled by
adding an optional parameter to the interrupt attribute like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt ("IRQ")));
     </pre>
     <p>Permissible values for this parameter are: IRQ, FIQ, SWI, ABORT and UNDEF.

     <br><dt><code>interrupt_handler</code><dd><a name="index-interrupt-handler-functions-on-the-H8_002f300-and-SH-processors-1634"></a>Use this attribute on the H8/300, H8/300H and SH to indicate that the
specified function is an interrupt handler.  The compiler will generate
function entry and exit sequences suitable for use in an interrupt
handler when this attribute is present.

     <br><dt><code>sp_switch</code><dd>Use this attribute on the SH to indicate an <code>interrupt_handler</code>
function should switch to an alternate stack.  It expects a string
argument that names a global variable holding the address of the
alternate stack.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void *alt_stack;
          void f () __attribute__ ((interrupt_handler,
                                    sp_switch ("alt_stack")));
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>trap_exit</code><dd>Use this attribute on the SH for an <code>interrupt_handle</code> to return using
<code>trapa</code> instead of <code>rte</code>.  This attribute expects an integer
argument specifying the trap number to be used.

     <br><dt><code>eightbit_data</code><dd><a name="index-eight-bit-data-on-the-H8_002f300-and-H8_002f300H-1635"></a>Use this attribute on the H8/300 and H8/300H to indicate that the specified
variable should be placed into the eight bit data section. 
The compiler will generate more efficient code for certain operations
on data in the eight bit data area.  Note the eight bit data area is limited to
256 bytes of data.

     <p>You must use GAS and GLD from GNU binutils version 2.7 or later for
this attribute to work correctly.

     <br><dt><code>tiny_data</code><dd><a name="index-tiny-data-section-on-the-H8_002f300H-1636"></a>Use this attribute on the H8/300H to indicate that the specified
variable should be placed into the tiny data section. 
The compiler will generate more efficient code for loads and stores
on data in the tiny data section.  Note the tiny data area is limited to
slightly under 32kbytes of data.

     <br><dt><code>signal</code><dd><a name="index-signal-handler-functions-on-the-AVR-processors-1637"></a>Use this attribute on the AVR to indicate that the specified
function is a signal handler.  The compiler will generate function
entry and exit sequences suitable for use in a signal handler when this
attribute is present.  Interrupts will be disabled inside the function.

     <br><dt><code>naked</code><dd><a name="index-function-without-a-prologue_002fepilogue-code-1638"></a>Use this attribute on the ARM, AVR and IP2K ports to indicate that the
specified function does not need prologue/epilogue sequences generated by
the compiler.  It is up to the programmer to provide these sequences.

     <br><dt><code>model (</code><var>model-name</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-function-addressability-on-the-M32R_002fD-1639"></a>Use this attribute on the M32R/D to set the addressability of an object,
and of the code generated for a function. 
The identifier <var>model-name</var> is one of <code>small</code>, <code>medium</code>,
or <code>large</code>, representing each of the code models.

     <p>Small model objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
addresses can be loaded with the <code>ld24</code> instruction), and are
callable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

     <p>Medium model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
compiler will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses),
and are callable with the <code>bl</code> instruction.

     <p>Large model objects may live anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the
compiler will generate <code>seth/add3</code> instructions to load their addresses),
and may not be reachable with the <code>bl</code> instruction (the compiler will
generate the much slower <code>seth/add3/jl</code> instruction sequence).

     <br><dt><code>far</code><dd><a name="index-functions-which-handle-memory-bank-switching-1640"></a>On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the <code>far</code> attribute causes the compiler to
use a calling convention that takes care of switching memory banks when
entering and leaving a function.  This calling convention is also the
default when using the <span class="option">-mlong-calls</span> option.

     <p>On 68HC12 the compiler will use the <code>call</code> and <code>rtc</code> instructions
to call and return from a function.

     <p>On 68HC11 the compiler will generate a sequence of instructions
to invoke a board-specific routine to switch the memory bank and call the
real function. The board-specific routine simulates a <code>call</code>. 
At the end of a function, it will jump to a board-specific routine
instead of using <code>rts</code>. The board-specific return routine simulates
the <code>rtc</code>.

     <br><dt><code>near</code><dd><a name="index-functions-which-do-not-handle-memory-bank-switching-on-68HC11_002f68HC12-1641"></a>On 68HC11 and 68HC12 the <code>near</code> attribute causes the compiler to
use the normal calling convention based on <code>jsr</code> and <code>rts</code>. 
This attribute can be used to cancel the effect of the <span class="option">-mlong-calls</span>
option.

     <br><dt><code>dllimport</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005f_005fdeclspec_0028dllimport_0029_007d-1642"></a>On Windows targets, the <code>dllimport</code> attribute causes the compiler
to reference a function or variable via a global pointer to a pointer
that is set up by the Windows dll library. The pointer name is formed by
combining <code>_imp__</code> and the function or variable name. The attribute
implies <code>extern</code> storage.

     <p>Currently, the attribute is ignored for inlined functions. If the
attribute is applied to a symbol <em>definition</em>, an error is reported. 
If a symbol previously declared <code>dllimport</code> is later defined, the
attribute is ignored in subsequent references, and a warning is emitted. 
The attribute is also overridden by a subsequent declaration as
<code>dllexport</code>.

     <p>When applied to C++ classes, the attribute marks non-inlined
member functions and static data members as imports.  However, the
attribute is ignored for virtual methods to allow creation of vtables
using thunks.

     <p>On cygwin, mingw and arm-pe targets, <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code> is
recognized as a synonym for <code>__attribute__ ((dllimport))</code> for
compatibility with other Windows compilers.

     <p>The use of the <code>dllimport</code> attribute on functions is not necessary,
but provides a small performance benefit by eliminating a thunk in the
dll. The use of the <code>dllimport</code> attribute on imported variables was
required on older versions of GNU ld, but can now be avoided by passing
the <span class="option">--enable-auto-import</span> switch to ld. As with functions, using
the attribute for a variable eliminates a thunk in the dll.

     <p>One drawback to using this attribute is that a pointer to a function or
variable marked as dllimport cannot be used as a constant address. The
attribute can be disabled for functions by setting the
<span class="option">-mnop-fun-dllimport</span> flag.

     <br><dt><code>dllexport</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007b_005f_005fdeclspec_0028dllexport_0029_007d-1643"></a>On Windows targets the <code>dllexport</code> attribute causes the compiler to
provide a global pointer to a pointer in a dll, so that it can be
referenced with the <code>dllimport</code> attribute. The pointer name is
formed by combining <code>_imp__</code> and the function or variable name.

     <p>Currently, the <code>dllexport</code>attribute is ignored for inlined
functions, but export can be forced by using the
<span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span> flag. The attribute is also ignored for
undefined symbols.

     <p>When applied to C++ classes. the attribute marks defined non-inlined
member functions and static data members as exports. Static consts
initialized in-class are not marked unless they are also defined
out-of-class.

     <p>On cygwin, mingw and arm-pe targets, <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> is
recognized as a synonym for <code>__attribute__ ((dllexport))</code> for
compatibility with other Windows compilers.

     <p>Alternative methods for including the symbol in the dll's export table
are to use a .def file with an <code>EXPORTS</code> section or, with GNU ld,
using the <span class="option">--export-all</span> linker flag.

   </dl>

   <p>You can specify multiple attributes in a declaration by separating them
by commas within the double parentheses or by immediately following an
attribute declaration with another attribute declaration.

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007b_0023pragma_007d_002c-reason-for-not-using-1644"></a><a name="index-pragma_002c-reason-for-not-using-1645"></a>Some people object to the <code>__attribute__</code> feature, suggesting that
ISO C's <code>#pragma</code> should be used instead.  At the time
<code>__attribute__</code> was designed, there were two reasons for not doing
this.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>It is impossible to generate <code>#pragma</code> commands from a macro.

     <li>There is no telling what the same <code>#pragma</code> might mean in another
compiler.
        </ol>

   <p>These two reasons applied to almost any application that might have been
proposed for <code>#pragma</code>.  It was basically a mistake to use
<code>#pragma</code> for <em>anything</em>.

   <p>The ISO C99 standard includes <code>_Pragma</code>, which now allows pragmas
to be generated from macros.  In addition, a <code>#pragma GCC</code>
namespace is now in use for GCC-specific pragmas.  However, it has been
found convenient to use <code>__attribute__</code> to achieve a natural
attachment of attributes to their corresponding declarations, whereas
<code>#pragma GCC</code> is of use for constructs that do not naturally form
part of the grammar.  See <a href="cpp.html#Other-Directives">Miscellaneous Preprocessing Directives (The GNU C Preprocessor)</a>.

<h3 class="section">5.26 Attribute Syntax</h3>

<p><a name="index-attribute-syntax-1646"></a>
This section describes the syntax with which <code>__attribute__</code> may be
used, and the constructs to which attribute specifiers bind, for the C
language.  Some details may vary for C++ and Objective-C.  Because of
infelicities in the grammar for attributes, some forms described here
may not be successfully parsed in all cases.

   <p>There are some problems with the semantics of attributes in C++.  For
example, there are no manglings for attributes, although they may affect
code generation, so problems may arise when attributed types are used in
conjunction with templates or overloading.  Similarly, <code>typeid</code>
does not distinguish between types with different attributes.  Support
for attributes in C++ may be restricted in future to attributes on
declarations only, but not on nested declarators.

   <p>See <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>, for details of the semantics of attributes
applying to functions.  See <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>, for details of the
semantics of attributes applying to variables.  See <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>,
for details of the semantics of attributes applying to structure, union
and enumerated types.

   <p>An <dfn>attribute specifier</dfn> is of the form
<code>__attribute__ ((</code><var>attribute-list</var><code>))</code>.  An <dfn>attribute list</dfn>
is a possibly empty comma-separated sequence of <dfn>attributes</dfn>, where
each attribute is one of the following:

     <ul>
<li>Empty.  Empty attributes are ignored.

     <li>A word (which may be an identifier such as <code>unused</code>, or a reserved
word such as <code>const</code>).

     <li>A word, followed by, in parentheses, parameters for the attribute. 
These parameters take one of the following forms:

          <ul>
<li>An identifier.  For example, <code>mode</code> attributes use this form.

          <li>An identifier followed by a comma and a non-empty comma-separated list
of expressions.  For example, <code>format</code> attributes use this form.

          <li>A possibly empty comma-separated list of expressions.  For example,
<code>format_arg</code> attributes use this form with the list being a single
integer constant expression, and <code>alias</code> attributes use this form
with the list being a single string constant. 
</ul>
     </ul>

   <p>An <dfn>attribute specifier list</dfn> is a sequence of one or more attribute
specifiers, not separated by any other tokens.

   <p>An attribute specifier list may appear after the colon following a
label, other than a <code>case</code> or <code>default</code> label.  The only
attribute it makes sense to use after a label is <code>unused</code>.  This
feature is intended for code generated by programs which contains labels
that may be unused but which is compiled with <span class="option">-Wall</span>.  It would
not normally be appropriate to use in it human-written code, though it
could be useful in cases where the code that jumps to the label is
contained within an <code>#ifdef</code> conditional.

   <p>An attribute specifier list may appear as part of a <code>struct</code>,
<code>union</code> or <code>enum</code> specifier.  It may go either immediately
after the <code>struct</code>, <code>union</code> or <code>enum</code> keyword, or after
the closing brace.  It is ignored if the content of the structure, union
or enumerated type is not defined in the specifier in which the
attribute specifier list is used&mdash;that is, in usages such as
<code>struct __attribute__((foo)) bar</code> with no following opening brace. 
Where attribute specifiers follow the closing brace, they are considered
to relate to the structure, union or enumerated type defined, not to any
enclosing declaration the type specifier appears in, and the type
defined is not complete until after the attribute specifiers. 
<!-- Otherwise, there would be the following problems: a shift/reduce -->
<!-- conflict between attributes binding the struct/union/enum and -->
<!-- binding to the list of specifiers/qualifiers; and "aligned" -->
<!-- attributes could use sizeof for the structure, but the size could be -->
<!-- changed later by "packed" attributes. -->

   <p>Otherwise, an attribute specifier appears as part of a declaration,
counting declarations of unnamed parameters and type names, and relates
to that declaration (which may be nested in another declaration, for
example in the case of a parameter declaration), or to a particular declarator
within a declaration.  Where an
attribute specifier is applied to a parameter declared as a function or
an array, it should apply to the function or array rather than the
pointer to which the parameter is implicitly converted, but this is not
yet correctly implemented.

   <p>Any list of specifiers and qualifiers at the start of a declaration may
contain attribute specifiers, whether or not such a list may in that
context contain storage class specifiers.  (Some attributes, however,
are essentially in the nature of storage class specifiers, and only make
sense where storage class specifiers may be used; for example,
<code>section</code>.)  There is one necessary limitation to this syntax: the
first old-style parameter declaration in a function definition cannot
begin with an attribute specifier, because such an attribute applies to
the function instead by syntax described below (which, however, is not
yet implemented in this case).  In some other cases, attribute
specifiers are permitted by this grammar but not yet supported by the
compiler.  All attribute specifiers in this place relate to the
declaration as a whole.  In the obsolescent usage where a type of
<code>int</code> is implied by the absence of type specifiers, such a list of
specifiers and qualifiers may be an attribute specifier list with no
other specifiers or qualifiers.

   <p>An attribute specifier list may appear immediately before a declarator
(other than the first) in a comma-separated list of declarators in a
declaration of more than one identifier using a single list of
specifiers and qualifiers.  Such attribute specifiers apply
only to the identifier before whose declarator they appear.  For
example, in

<pre class="smallexample">     __attribute__((noreturn)) void d0 (void),
         __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2))) d1 (const char *, ...),
          d2 (void)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the <code>noreturn</code> attribute applies to all the functions
declared; the <code>format</code> attribute only applies to <code>d1</code>.

   <p>An attribute specifier list may appear immediately before the comma,
<code>=</code> or semicolon terminating the declaration of an identifier other
than a function definition.  At present, such attribute specifiers apply
to the declared object or function, but in future they may attach to the
outermost adjacent declarator.  In simple cases there is no difference,
but, for example, in

<pre class="smallexample">     void (****f)(void) __attribute__((noreturn));
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">at present the <code>noreturn</code> attribute applies to <code>f</code>, which
causes a warning since <code>f</code> is not a function, but in future it may
apply to the function <code>****f</code>.  The precise semantics of what
attributes in such cases will apply to are not yet specified.  Where an
assembler name for an object or function is specified (see <a href="#Asm-Labels">Asm Labels</a>), at present the attribute must follow the <code>asm</code>
specification; in future, attributes before the <code>asm</code> specification
may apply to the adjacent declarator, and those after it to the declared
object or function.

   <p>An attribute specifier list may, in future, be permitted to appear after
the declarator in a function definition (before any old-style parameter
declarations or the function body).

   <p>Attribute specifiers may be mixed with type qualifiers appearing inside
the <code>[]</code> of a parameter array declarator, in the C99 construct by
which such qualifiers are applied to the pointer to which the array is
implicitly converted.  Such attribute specifiers apply to the pointer,
not to the array, but at present this is not implemented and they are
ignored.

   <p>An attribute specifier list may appear at the start of a nested
declarator.  At present, there are some limitations in this usage: the
attributes correctly apply to the declarator, but for most individual
attributes the semantics this implies are not implemented. 
When attribute specifiers follow the <code>*</code> of a pointer
declarator, they may be mixed with any type qualifiers present. 
The following describes the formal semantics of this syntax.  It will make the
most sense if you are familiar with the formal specification of
declarators in the ISO C standard.

   <p>Consider (as in C99 subclause 6.7.5 paragraph 4) a declaration <code>T
D1</code>, where <code>T</code> contains declaration specifiers that specify a type
<var>Type</var> (such as <code>int</code>) and <code>D1</code> is a declarator that
contains an identifier <var>ident</var>.  The type specified for <var>ident</var>
for derived declarators whose type does not include an attribute
specifier is as in the ISO C standard.

   <p>If <code>D1</code> has the form <code>( </code><var>attribute-specifier-list</var><code> D )</code>,
and the declaration <code>T D</code> specifies the type
&ldquo;<var>derived-declarator-type-list</var> <var>Type</var>&rdquo; for <var>ident</var>, then
<code>T D1</code> specifies the type &ldquo;<var>derived-declarator-type-list</var>
<var>attribute-specifier-list</var> <var>Type</var>&rdquo; for <var>ident</var>.

   <p>If <code>D1</code> has the form <code>*
</code><var>type-qualifier-and-attribute-specifier-list</var><code> D</code>, and the
declaration <code>T D</code> specifies the type
&ldquo;<var>derived-declarator-type-list</var> <var>Type</var>&rdquo; for <var>ident</var>, then
<code>T D1</code> specifies the type &ldquo;<var>derived-declarator-type-list</var>
<var>type-qualifier-and-attribute-specifier-list</var> <var>Type</var>&rdquo; for
<var>ident</var>.

   <p>For example,

<pre class="smallexample">     void (__attribute__((noreturn)) ****f) (void);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies the type &ldquo;pointer to pointer to pointer to pointer to
non-returning function returning <code>void</code>&rdquo;.  As another example,

<pre class="smallexample">     char *__attribute__((aligned(8))) *f;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies the type &ldquo;pointer to 8-byte-aligned pointer to <code>char</code>&rdquo;. 
Note again that this does not work with most attributes; for example,
the usage of <span class="samp">aligned</span> and <span class="samp">noreturn</span> attributes given above
is not yet supported.

   <p>For compatibility with existing code written for compiler versions that
did not implement attributes on nested declarators, some laxity is
allowed in the placing of attributes.  If an attribute that only applies
to types is applied to a declaration, it will be treated as applying to
the type of that declaration.  If an attribute that only applies to
declarations is applied to the type of a declaration, it will be treated
as applying to that declaration; and, for compatibility with code
placing the attributes immediately before the identifier declared, such
an attribute applied to a function return type will be treated as
applying to the function type, and such an attribute applied to an array
element type will be treated as applying to the array type.  If an
attribute that only applies to function types is applied to a
pointer-to-function type, it will be treated as applying to the pointer
target type; if such an attribute is applied to a function return type
that is not a pointer-to-function type, it will be treated as applying
to the function type.

<p><a name="index-function-prototype-declarations-1647"></a><a name="index-old_002dstyle-function-definitions-1648"></a><a name="index-promotion-of-formal-parameters-1649"></a>
GNU C extends ISO C to allow a function prototype to override a later
old-style non-prototype definition.  Consider the following example:

<pre class="example">     /* <span class="roman">Use prototypes unless the compiler is old-fashioned.</span>  */
     #ifdef __STDC__
     #define P(x) x
     #else
     #define P(x) ()
     #endif
     
     /* <span class="roman">Prototype function declaration.</span>  */
     int isroot P((uid_t));
     
     /* <span class="roman">Old-style function definition.</span>  */
     int
     isroot (x)   /* ??? lossage here ??? */
          uid_t x;
     {
       return x == 0;
     }
</pre>
   <p>Suppose the type <code>uid_t</code> happens to be <code>short</code>.  ISO C does
not allow this example, because subword arguments in old-style
non-prototype definitions are promoted.  Therefore in this example the
function definition's argument is really an <code>int</code>, which does not
match the prototype argument type of <code>short</code>.

   <p>This restriction of ISO C makes it hard to write code that is portable
to traditional C compilers, because the programmer does not know
whether the <code>uid_t</code> type is <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, or
<code>long</code>.  Therefore, in cases like these GNU C allows a prototype
to override a later old-style definition.  More precisely, in GNU C, a
function prototype argument type overrides the argument type specified
by a later old-style definition if the former type is the same as the
latter type before promotion.  Thus in GNU C the above example is
equivalent to the following:

<pre class="example">     int isroot (uid_t);
     
     int
     isroot (uid_t x)
     {
       return x == 0;
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">GNU C++ does not support old-style function definitions, so this
extension is irrelevant.

In GNU C, you may use C++ style comments, which start with <span class="samp">//</span> and
continue until the end of the line.  Many other C implementations allow
such comments, and they are included in the 1999 C standard.  However,
C++ style comments are not recognized if you specify an <span class="option">-std</span>

<h3 class="section">5.31 Inquiring on Alignment of Types or Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-alignment-1656"></a><a name="index-type-alignment-1657"></a><a name="index-variable-alignment-1658"></a>
The keyword <code>__alignof__</code> allows you to inquire about how an object
is aligned, or the minimum alignment usually required by a type.  Its
syntax is just like <code>sizeof</code>.

   <p>For example, if the target machine requires a <code>double</code> value to be
aligned on an 8-byte boundary, then <code>__alignof__ (double)</code> is 8. 
This is true on many RISC machines.  On more traditional machine
designs, <code>__alignof__ (double)</code> is 4 or even 2.

   <p>Some machines never actually require alignment; they allow reference to any
data type even at an odd address.  For these machines, <code>__alignof__</code>
reports the <em>recommended</em> alignment of a type.

   <p>If the operand of <code>__alignof__</code> is an lvalue rather than a type,
its value is the required alignment for its type, taking into account
any minimum alignment specified with GCC's <code>__attribute__</code>
extension (see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>).  For example, after this
declaration:

<pre class="example">     struct foo { int x; char y; } foo1;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the value of <code>__alignof__ (foo1.y)</code> is 1, even though its actual
alignment is probably 2 or 4, the same as <code>__alignof__ (int)</code>.

   <p>It is an error to ask for the alignment of an incomplete type.

<h3 class="section">5.32 Specifying Attributes of Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-attribute-of-variables-1659"></a><a name="index-variable-attributes-1660"></a>
The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes of variables or structure fields.  This keyword is followed
by an attribute specification inside double parentheses.  Some
attributes are currently defined generically for variables. 
Other attributes are defined for variables on particular target
systems.  Other attributes are available for functions
(see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>) and for types (see <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>). 
Other front ends might define more attributes
(see <a href="#C_002b_002b-Extensions">Extensions to the C++ Language</a>).

   <p>You may also specify attributes with <span class="samp">__</span> preceding and following
each keyword.  This allows you to use them in header files without
being concerned about a possible macro of the same name.  For example,
you may use <code>__aligned__</code> instead of <code>aligned</code>.

   <p>See <a href="#Attribute-Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.

     
<a name="index-_0040code_007baligned_007d-attribute-1661"></a>
<dl><dt><code>aligned (</code><var>alignment</var><code>)</code><dd>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment for the variable or
structure field, measured in bytes.  For example, the declaration:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int x __attribute__ ((aligned (16))) = 0;
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to allocate the global variable <code>x</code> on a
16-byte boundary.  On a 68040, this could be used in conjunction with
an <code>asm</code> expression to access the <code>move16</code> instruction which
requires 16-byte aligned operands.

     <p>You can also specify the alignment of structure fields.  For example, to
create a double-word aligned <code>int</code> pair, you could write:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct foo { int x[2] __attribute__ ((aligned (8))); };
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">This is an alternative to creating a union with a <code>double</code> member
that forces the union to be double-word aligned.

     <p>As in the preceding examples, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given variable or
structure field.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a variable or field to the maximum
useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling for.  For
example, you could write:

     <pre class="smallexample">          short array[3] __attribute__ ((aligned));
     </pre>
     <p>Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an <code>aligned</code> attribute
specification, the compiler automatically sets the alignment for the declared
variable or field to the largest alignment which is ever used for any data
type on the target machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often make
copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use whatever
instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing copies to
or from the variables or fields that you have aligned this way.

     <p>The <code>aligned</code> attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
can decrease it by specifying <code>packed</code> as well.  See below.

     <p>Note that the effectiveness of <code>aligned</code> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment, then specifying <code>aligned(16)</code>
in an <code>__attribute__</code> will still only provide you with 8 byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.

     <br><dt><code>cleanup (</code><var>cleanup_function</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bcleanup_007d-attribute-1662"></a>The <code>cleanup</code> attribute runs a function when the variable goes
out of scope.  This attribute can only be applied to auto function
scope variables; it may not be applied to parameters or variables
with static storage duration.  The function must take one parameter,
a pointer to a type compatible with the variable.  The return value
of the function (if any) is ignored.

     <p>If <span class="option">-fexceptions</span> is enabled, then <var>cleanup_function</var>
will be run during the stack unwinding that happens during the
processing of the exception.  Note that the <code>cleanup</code> attribute
does not allow the exception to be caught, only to perform an action. 
It is undefined what happens if <var>cleanup_function</var> does not
return normally.

     <br><dt><code>common</code><dt><code>nocommon</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bcommon_007d-attribute-1663"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bnocommon_007d-attribute-1664"></a><a name="index-fcommon-1665"></a><a name="index-fno_002dcommon-1666"></a>The <code>common</code> attribute requests GCC to place a variable in
&ldquo;common&rdquo; storage.  The <code>nocommon</code> attribute requests the
opposite &ndash; to allocate space for it directly.

     <p>These attributes override the default chosen by the
<span class="option">-fno-common</span> and <span class="option">-fcommon</span> flags respectively.

     <br><dt><code>deprecated</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bdeprecated_007d-attribute-1667"></a>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute results in a warning if the variable
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
variables that are expected to be removed in a future version of a
program.  The warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated variable, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the variable is deprecated, or what they should
do instead.  Note that the warning only occurs for uses:

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern int old_var __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          extern int old_var;
          int new_fn () { return old_var; }
     </pre>
     <p>results in a warning on line 3 but not line 2.

     <p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute can also be used for functions and
types (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>, see <a href="#Type-Attributes">Type Attributes</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>mode (</code><var>mode</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bmode_007d-attribute-1668"></a>This attribute specifies the data type for the declaration&mdash;whichever
type corresponds to the mode <var>mode</var>.  This in effect lets you
request an integer or floating point type according to its width.

     <p>You may also specify a mode of <span class="samp">byte</span> or <span class="samp">__byte__</span> to
indicate the mode corresponding to a one-byte integer, <span class="samp">word</span> or
<span class="samp">__word__</span> for the mode of a one-word integer, and <span class="samp">pointer</span>
or <span class="samp">__pointer__</span> for the mode used to represent pointers.

     <br><dt><code>packed</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bpacked_007d-attribute-1669"></a>The <code>packed</code> attribute specifies that a variable or structure field
should have the smallest possible alignment&mdash;one byte for a variable,
and one bit for a field, unless you specify a larger value with the
<code>aligned</code> attribute.

     <p>Here is a structure in which the field <code>x</code> is packed, so that it
immediately follows <code>a</code>:

     <pre class="example">          struct foo
          {
            char a;
            int x[2] __attribute__ ((packed));
          };
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>section ("</code><var>section-name</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bsection_007d-variable-attribute-1670"></a>Normally, the compiler places the objects it generates in sections like
<code>data</code> and <code>bss</code>.  Sometimes, however, you need additional sections,
or you need certain particular variables to appear in special sections,
for example to map to special hardware.  The <code>section</code>
attribute specifies that a variable (or function) lives in a particular
section.  For example, this small program uses several specific section names:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct duart a __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_A"))) = { 0 };
          struct duart b __attribute__ ((section ("DUART_B"))) = { 0 };
          char stack[10000] __attribute__ ((section ("STACK"))) = { 0 };
          int init_data __attribute__ ((section ("INITDATA"))) = 0;
          
          main()
          {
            /* Initialize stack pointer */
            init_sp (stack + sizeof (stack));
          
            /* Initialize initialized data */
            memcpy (&amp;init_data, &amp;data, &amp;edata - &amp;data);
          
            /* Turn on the serial ports */
            init_duart (&amp;a);
            init_duart (&amp;b);
          }
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Use the <code>section</code> attribute with an <em>initialized</em> definition
of a <em>global</em> variable, as shown in the example.  GCC issues
a warning and otherwise ignores the <code>section</code> attribute in
uninitialized variable declarations.

     <p>You may only use the <code>section</code> attribute with a fully initialized
global definition because of the way linkers work.  The linker requires
each object be defined once, with the exception that uninitialized
variables tentatively go in the <code>common</code> (or <code>bss</code>) section
and can be multiply &ldquo;defined&rdquo;.  You can force a variable to be
initialized with the <span class="option">-fno-common</span> flag or the <code>nocommon</code>
attribute.

     <p>Some file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the <code>section</code>
attribute is not available on all platforms. 
If you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular
section, consider using the facilities of the linker instead.

     <br><dt><code>shared</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007bshared_007d-variable-attribute-1671"></a>On Windows, in addition to putting variable definitions in a named
section, the section can also be shared among all running copies of an
executable or DLL.  For example, this small program defines shared data
by putting it in a named section <code>shared</code> and marking the section
shareable:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int foo __attribute__((section ("shared"), shared)) = 0;
          
          int
          main()
          {
            /* Read and write foo.  All running
               copies see the same value.  */
            return 0;
          }
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">You may only use the <code>shared</code> attribute along with <code>section</code>
attribute with a fully initialized global definition because of the way
linkers work.  See <code>section</code> attribute for more information.

     <p>The <code>shared</code> attribute is only available on Windows.

     <br><dt><code>tls_model ("</code><var>tls_model</var><code>")</code><dd><a name="index-_0040code_007btls_005fmodel_007d-attribute-1672"></a>The <code>tls_model</code> attribute sets thread-local storage model
(see <a href="#Thread_002dLocal">Thread-Local</a>) of a particular <code>__thread</code> variable,
overriding <code>-ftls-model=</code> command line switch on a per-variable
basis. 
The <var>tls_model</var> argument should be one of <code>global-dynamic</code>,
<code>local-dynamic</code>, <code>initial-exec</code> or <code>local-exec</code>.

     <p>Not all targets support this attribute.

     <br><dt><code>transparent_union</code><dd>This attribute, attached to a function parameter which is a union, means
that the corresponding argument may have the type of any union member,
but the argument is passed as if its type were that of the first union

this attribute on a <code>typedef</code> for a union data type; then it
applies to all function parameters with that type.

     <br><dt><code>unused</code><dd>This attribute, attached to a variable, means that the variable is meant
to be possibly unused.  GCC will not produce a warning for this
variable.

     <br><dt><code>vector_size (</code><var>bytes</var><code>)</code><dd>This attribute specifies the vector size for the variable, measured in

     <p class="noindent">causes the compiler to set the mode for <code>foo</code>, to be 16 bytes,
divided into <code>int</code> sized units.  Assuming a 32-bit int (a vector of
4 units of 4 bytes), the corresponding mode of <code>foo</code> will be V4SI.

     <p>This attribute is only applicable to integral and float scalars,

          struct S  __attribute__ ((vector_size (16))) foo;
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">is invalid even if the size of the structure is the same as the size of

<h3 class="section">5.33 Specifying Attributes of Types</h3>

<p><a name="index-attribute-of-types-1674"></a><a name="index-type-attributes-1675"></a>
The keyword <code>__attribute__</code> allows you to specify special
attributes of <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> types when you define such
types.  This keyword is followed by an attribute specification inside
double parentheses.  Six attributes are currently defined for types:
<code>aligned</code>, <code>packed</code>, <code>transparent_union</code>, <code>unused</code>,
<code>deprecated</code> and <code>may_alias</code>.  Other attributes are defined for
functions (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>) and for variables
(see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>).

   <p>You may also specify any one of these attributes with <span class="samp">__</span>
preceding and following its keyword.  This allows you to use these
attributes in header files without being concerned about a possible
macro of the same name.  For example, you may use <code>__aligned__</code>
instead of <code>aligned</code>.

   <p>You may specify the <code>aligned</code> and <code>transparent_union</code>
attributes either in a <code>typedef</code> declaration or just past the
closing curly brace of a complete enum, struct or union type
<em>definition</em> and the <code>packed</code> attribute only past the closing
brace of a definition.

   <p>You may also specify attributes between the enum, struct or union
tag and the name of the type rather than after the closing brace.

   <p>See <a href="#Attribute-Syntax">Attribute Syntax</a>, for details of the exact syntax for using
attributes.

     
<a name="index-_0040code_007baligned_007d-attribute-1676"></a>
<dl><dt><code>aligned (</code><var>alignment</var><code>)</code><dd>This attribute specifies a minimum alignment (in bytes) for variables
of the specified type.  For example, the declarations:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
          typedef int more_aligned_int __attribute__ ((aligned (8)));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">force the compiler to insure (as far as it can) that each variable whose
type is <code>struct S</code> or <code>more_aligned_int</code> will be allocated and
aligned <em>at least</em> on a 8-byte boundary.  On a SPARC, having all
variables of type <code>struct S</code> aligned to 8-byte boundaries allows
the compiler to use the <code>ldd</code> and <code>std</code> (doubleword load and
store) instructions when copying one variable of type <code>struct S</code> to
another, thus improving run-time efficiency.

     <p>Note that the alignment of any given <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type
is required by the ISO C standard to be at least a perfect multiple of
the lowest common multiple of the alignments of all of the members of
the <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> in question.  This means that you <em>can</em>
effectively adjust the alignment of a <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code>
type by attaching an <code>aligned</code> attribute to any one of the members
of such a type, but the notation illustrated in the example above is a
more obvious, intuitive, and readable way to request the compiler to
adjust the alignment of an entire <code>struct</code> or <code>union</code> type.

     <p>As in the preceding example, you can explicitly specify the alignment
(in bytes) that you wish the compiler to use for a given <code>struct</code>
or <code>union</code> type.  Alternatively, you can leave out the alignment factor
and just ask the compiler to align a type to the maximum
useful alignment for the target machine you are compiling for.  For
example, you could write:

     <pre class="smallexample">          struct S { short f[3]; } __attribute__ ((aligned));
     </pre>
     <p>Whenever you leave out the alignment factor in an <code>aligned</code>
attribute specification, the compiler automatically sets the alignment
for the type to the largest alignment which is ever used for any data
type on the target machine you are compiling for.  Doing this can often
make copy operations more efficient, because the compiler can use
whatever instructions copy the biggest chunks of memory when performing
copies to or from the variables which have types that you have aligned
this way.

     <p>In the example above, if the size of each <code>short</code> is 2 bytes, then
the size of the entire <code>struct S</code> type is 6 bytes.  The smallest
power of two which is greater than or equal to that is 8, so the
compiler sets the alignment for the entire <code>struct S</code> type to 8
bytes.

     <p>Note that although you can ask the compiler to select a time-efficient
alignment for a given type and then declare only individual stand-alone
objects of that type, the compiler's ability to select a time-efficient
alignment is primarily useful only when you plan to create arrays of
variables having the relevant (efficiently aligned) type.  If you
declare or use arrays of variables of an efficiently-aligned type, then
it is likely that your program will also be doing pointer arithmetic (or
subscripting, which amounts to the same thing) on pointers to the
relevant type, and the code that the compiler generates for these
pointer arithmetic operations will often be more efficient for
efficiently-aligned types than for other types.

     <p>The <code>aligned</code> attribute can only increase the alignment; but you
can decrease it by specifying <code>packed</code> as well.  See below.

     <p>Note that the effectiveness of <code>aligned</code> attributes may be limited
by inherent limitations in your linker.  On many systems, the linker is
only able to arrange for variables to be aligned up to a certain maximum
alignment.  (For some linkers, the maximum supported alignment may
be very very small.)  If your linker is only able to align variables
up to a maximum of 8 byte alignment, then specifying <code>aligned(16)</code>
in an <code>__attribute__</code> will still only provide you with 8 byte
alignment.  See your linker documentation for further information.

     <br><dt><code>packed</code><dd>This attribute, attached to an <code>enum</code>, <code>struct</code>, or
<code>union</code> type definition, specifies that the minimum required memory
be used to represent the type.

     <p><a name="index-fshort_002denums-1677"></a>Specifying this attribute for <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code> types is
equivalent to specifying the <code>packed</code> attribute on each of the
structure or union members.  Specifying the <span class="option">-fshort-enums</span>
flag on the line is equivalent to specifying the <code>packed</code>
attribute on all <code>enum</code> definitions.

     <p>You may only specify this attribute after a closing curly brace on an
<code>enum</code> definition, not in a <code>typedef</code> declaration, unless that
declaration also contains the definition of the <code>enum</code>.

     <br><dt><code>transparent_union</code><dd>This attribute, attached to a <code>union</code> type definition, indicates
that any function parameter having that union type causes calls to that
function to be treated in a special way.

     <p>First, the argument corresponding to a transparent union type can be of
any type in the union; no cast is required.  Also, if the union contains
a pointer type, the corresponding argument can be a null pointer
constant or a void pointer expression; and if the union contains a void
pointer type, the corresponding argument can be any pointer expression. 
If the union member type is a pointer, qualifiers like <code>const</code> on
the referenced type must be respected, just as with normal pointer
conversions.

     <p>Second, the argument is passed to the function using the calling
conventions of the first member of the transparent union, not the calling
conventions of the union itself.  All members of the union must have the
same machine representation; this is necessary for this argument passing
to work properly.

     <p>Transparent unions are designed for library functions that have multiple
interfaces for compatibility reasons.  For example, suppose the
<code>wait</code> function must accept either a value of type <code>int *</code> to
comply with Posix, or a value of type <code>union wait *</code> to comply with
the 4.1BSD interface.  If <code>wait</code>'s parameter were <code>void *</code>,
<code>wait</code> would accept both kinds of arguments, but it would also
accept any other pointer type and this would make argument type checking
less useful.  Instead, <code>&lt;sys/wait.h&gt;</code> might define the interface
as follows:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef union
            {
              int *__ip;
              union wait *__up;
            } wait_status_ptr_t __attribute__ ((__transparent_union__));
          
          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t);
     </pre>
     <p>This interface allows either <code>int *</code> or <code>union wait *</code>
arguments to be passed, using the <code>int *</code> calling convention. 
The program can call <code>wait</code> with arguments of either type:

     <pre class="example">          int w1 () { int w; return wait (&amp;w); }
          int w2 () { union wait w; return wait (&amp;w); }
     </pre>
     <p>With this interface, <code>wait</code>'s implementation might look like this:

     <pre class="example">          pid_t wait (wait_status_ptr_t p)
          {
            return waitpid (-1, p.__ip, 0);
          }
     </pre>
     <br><dt><code>unused</code><dd>When attached to a type (including a <code>union</code> or a <code>struct</code>),
this attribute means that variables of that type are meant to appear
possibly unused.  GCC will not produce a warning for any variables of
that type, even if the variable appears to do nothing.  This is often
the case with lock or thread classes, which are usually defined and then

nontrivial bookkeeping functions.

     <br><dt><code>deprecated</code><dd>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute results in a warning if the type
is used anywhere in the source file.  This is useful when identifying
types that are expected to be removed in a future version of a program. 
If possible, the warning also includes the location of the declaration
of the deprecated type, to enable users to easily find further
information about why the type is deprecated, or what they should do
instead.  Note that the warnings only occur for uses and then only
if the type is being applied to an identifier that itself is not being
declared as deprecated.

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef int T1 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          T1 x;
          typedef T1 T2;

          typedef T1 T3 __attribute__ ((deprecated));
          T3 z __attribute__ ((deprecated));
     </pre>
     <p>results in a warning on line 2 and 3 but not lines 4, 5, or 6.  No
warning is issued for line 4 because T2 is not explicitly
deprecated.  Line 5 has no warning because T3 is explicitly
deprecated.  Similarly for line 6.

     <p>The <code>deprecated</code> attribute can also be used for functions and
variables (see <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>, see <a href="#Variable-Attributes">Variable Attributes</a>.)

     <br><dt><code>may_alias</code><dd>Accesses to objects with types with this attribute are not subjected to
type-based alias analysis, but are instead assumed to be able to alias

     <p>Example of use:

     <pre class="smallexample">          typedef short __attribute__((__may_alias__)) short_a;

<p><a name="index-inline-functions-1678"></a><a name="index-integrating-function-code-1679"></a><a name="index-open-coding-1680"></a><a name="index-macros_002c-inline-alternative-1681"></a>
By declaring a function <code>inline</code>, you can direct GCC to
integrate that function's code into the code for its callers.  This
makes execution faster by eliminating the function-call overhead; in
addition, if any of the actual argument values are constant, their known
values may permit simplifications at compile time so that not all of the
inline function's code needs to be included.  The effect on code size is
less predictable; object code may be larger or smaller with function
inlining, depending on the particular case.  Inlining of functions is an
optimization and it really &ldquo;works&rdquo; only in optimizing compilation.  If
you don't use <span class="option">-O</span>, no function is really inline.

   <p>Inline functions are included in the ISO C99 standard, but there are
currently substantial differences between what GCC implements and what
the ISO C99 standard requires.

   <p>To declare a function inline, use the <code>inline</code> keyword in its
declaration, like this:

<pre class="example">     inline int
     inc (int *a)
     {
       (*a)++;
     }
</pre>
   <p>(If you are writing a header file to be included in ISO C programs, write
<code>__inline__</code> instead of <code>inline</code>.  See <a href="#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.) 
You can also make all &ldquo;simple enough&rdquo; functions inline with the option
<span class="option">-finline-functions</span>.

   <p><a name="index-Winline-1682"></a>Note that certain usages in a function definition can make it unsuitable
for inline substitution.  Among these usages are: use of varargs, use of
alloca, use of variable sized data types (see <a href="#Variable-Length">Variable Length</a>),
use of computed goto (see <a href="#Labels-as-Values">Labels as Values</a>), use of nonlocal goto,
and nested functions (see <a href="#Nested-Functions">Nested Functions</a>).  Using <span class="option">-Winline</span>
will warn when a function marked <code>inline</code> could not be substituted,
and will give the reason for the failure.

   <p>Note that in C and Objective-C, unlike C++, the <code>inline</code> keyword
does not affect the linkage of the function.

   <p><a name="index-automatic-_0040code_007binline_007d-for-C_002b_002b-member-fns-1683"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007binline_007d-automatic-for-C_002b_002b-member-fns-1684"></a><a name="index-member-fns_002c-automatically-_0040code_007binline_007d-1685"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-member-fns_002c-automatically-_0040code_007binline_007d-1686"></a><a name="index-fno_002ddefault_002dinline-1687"></a>GCC automatically inlines member functions defined within the class
body of C++ programs even if they are not explicitly declared
<code>inline</code>.  (You can override this with <span class="option">-fno-default-inline</span>;
see <a href="#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C++ Dialect</a>.)

   <p><a name="index-inline-functions_002c-omission-of-1688"></a><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002dfunctions-1689"></a>When a function is both inline and <code>static</code>, if all calls to the
function are integrated into the caller, and the function's address is
never used, then the function's own assembler code is never referenced. 
In this case, GCC does not actually output assembler code for the
function, unless you specify the option <span class="option">-fkeep-inline-functions</span>. 
Some calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular,
calls that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and
neither can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a
nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as
usual.  The function must also be compiled as usual if the program
refers to its address, because that can't be inlined.

   <p><a name="index-non_002dstatic-inline-function-1690"></a>When an inline function is not <code>static</code>, then the compiler must assume
that there may be calls from other source files; since a global symbol can
be defined only once in any program, the function must not be defined in
the other source files, so the calls therein cannot be integrated. 
Therefore, a non-<code>static</code> inline function is always compiled on its
own in the usual fashion.

   <p>If you specify both <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code> in the function
definition, then the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case
is the function compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its
address explicitly.  Such an address becomes an external reference, as
if you had only declared the function, and had not defined it.

   <p>This combination of <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code> has almost the
effect of a macro.  The way to use it is to put a function definition in
a header file with these keywords, and put another copy of the
definition (lacking <code>inline</code> and <code>extern</code>) in a library file. 
The definition in the header file will cause most calls to the function
to be inlined.  If any uses of the function remain, they will refer to
the single copy in the library.

   <p>Since GCC eventually will implement ISO C99 semantics for
inline functions, it is best to use <code>static inline</code> only
to guarantee compatibility.  (The
existing semantics will remain available when <span class="option">-std=gnu89</span> is
specified, but eventually the default will be <span class="option">-std=gnu99</span> and
that will implement the C99 semantics, though it does not do so yet.)

   <p>GCC does not inline any functions when not optimizing unless you specify
the <span class="samp">always_inline</span> attribute for the function, like this:

<pre class="example">     /* Prototype.  */
     inline void foo (const char) __attribute__((always_inline));

<h3 class="section">5.35 Assembler Instructions with C Expression Operands</h3>

<p><a name="index-extended-_0040code_007basm_007d-1691"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007basm_007d-expressions-1692"></a><a name="index-assembler-instructions-1693"></a><a name="index-registers-1694"></a>
In an assembler instruction using <code>asm</code>, you can specify the
operands of the instruction using C expressions.  This means you need not
guess which registers or memory locations will contain the data you want
to use.

   <p>You must specify an assembler instruction template much like what
appears in a machine description, plus an operand constraint string for
each operand.

   <p>For example, here is how to use the 68881's <code>fsinx</code> instruction:

<pre class="example">     asm ("fsinx %1,%0" : "=f" (result) : "f" (angle));
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here <code>angle</code> is the C expression for the input operand while
<code>result</code> is that of the output operand.  Each has <span class="samp">"f"</span> as its
operand constraint, saying that a floating point register is required. 
The <span class="samp">=</span> in <span class="samp">=f</span> indicates that the operand is an output; all
output operands' constraints must use <span class="samp">=</span>.  The constraints use the
same language used in the machine description (see <a href="#Constraints">Constraints</a>).

   <p>Each operand is described by an operand-constraint string followed by
the C expression in parentheses.  A colon separates the assembler
template from the first output operand and another separates the last
output operand from the first input, if any.  Commas separate the
operands within each group.  The total number of operands is currently
limited to 30; this limitation may be lifted in some future version of
GCC.

   <p>If there are no output operands but there are input operands, you must
place two consecutive colons surrounding the place where the output
operands would go.

   <p>As of GCC version 3.1, it is also possible to specify input and output
operands using symbolic names which can be referenced within the
assembler code.  These names are specified inside square brackets
preceding the constraint string, and can be referenced inside the
assembler code using <code>%[</code><var>name</var><code>]</code> instead of a percentage sign
followed by the operand number.  Using named operands the above example
could look like:

<pre class="example">     asm ("fsinx %[angle],%[output]"
          : [output] "=f" (result)
          : [angle] "f" (angle));
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Note that the symbolic operand names have no relation whatsoever to
other C identifiers.  You may use any name you like, even those of
existing C symbols, but you must ensure that no two operands within the same
assembler construct use the same symbolic name.

   <p>Output operand expressions must be lvalues; the compiler can check this. 
The input operands need not be lvalues.  The compiler cannot check
whether the operands have data types that are reasonable for the
instruction being executed.  It does not parse the assembler instruction
template and does not know what it means or even whether it is valid
assembler input.  The extended <code>asm</code> feature is most often used for
machine instructions the compiler itself does not know exist.  If
the output expression cannot be directly addressed (for example, it is a
bit-field), your constraint must allow a register.  In that case, GCC
will use the register as the output of the <code>asm</code>, and then store
that register into the output.

   <p>The ordinary output operands must be write-only; GCC will assume that
the values in these operands before the instruction are dead and need
not be generated.  Extended asm supports input-output or read-write
operands.  Use the constraint character <span class="samp">+</span> to indicate such an
operand and list it with the output operands.

   <p>When the constraints for the read-write operand (or the operand in which
only some of the bits are to be changed) allows a register, you may, as
an alternative, logically split its function into two separate operands,
one input operand and one write-only output operand.  The connection
between them is expressed by constraints which say they need to be in
the same location when the instruction executes.  You can use the same C
expression for both operands, or different expressions.  For example,
here we write the (fictitious) <span class="samp">combine</span> instruction with
<code>bar</code> as its read-only source operand and <code>foo</code> as its
read-write destination:

<pre class="example">     asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The constraint <span class="samp">"0"</span> for operand 1 says that it must occupy the
same location as operand 0.  A number in constraint is allowed only in
an input operand and it must refer to an output operand.

   <p>Only a number in the constraint can guarantee that one operand will be in
the same place as another.  The mere fact that <code>foo</code> is the value
of both operands is not enough to guarantee that they will be in the
same place in the generated assembler code.  The following would not
work reliably:

<pre class="example">     asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "r" (foo), "g" (bar));
</pre>
   <p>Various optimizations or reloading could cause operands 0 and 1 to be in
different registers; GCC knows no reason not to do so.  For example, the
compiler might find a copy of the value of <code>foo</code> in one register and
use it for operand 1, but generate the output operand 0 in a different
register (copying it afterward to <code>foo</code>'s own address).  Of course,
since the register for operand 1 is not even mentioned in the assembler
code, the result will not work, but GCC can't tell that.

   <p>As of GCC version 3.1, one may write <code>[</code><var>name</var><code>]</code> instead of
the operand number for a matching constraint.  For example:

<pre class="example">     asm ("cmoveq %1,%2,%[result]"
          : [result] "=r"(result)
          : "r" (test), "r"(new), "[result]"(old));
</pre>
   <p>Some instructions clobber specific hard registers.  To describe this,
write a third colon after the input operands, followed by the names of
the clobbered hard registers (given as strings).  Here is a realistic
example for the VAX:

<pre class="example">     asm volatile ("movc3 %0,%1,%2"
                   : /* no outputs */
                   : "g" (from), "g" (to), "g" (count)
                   : "r0", "r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5");
</pre>
   <p>You may not write a clobber description in a way that overlaps with an
input or output operand.  For example, you may not have an operand
describing a register class with one member if you mention that register
in the clobber list.  Variables declared to live in specific registers
(see <a href="#Explicit-Reg-Vars">Explicit Reg Vars</a>), and used as asm input or output operands must
have no part mentioned in the clobber description. 
There is no way for you to specify that an input
operand is modified without also specifying it as an output
operand.  Note that if all the output operands you specify are for this
purpose (and hence unused), you will then also need to specify
<code>volatile</code> for the <code>asm</code> construct, as described below, to
prevent GCC from deleting the <code>asm</code> statement as unused.

   <p>If you refer to a particular hardware register from the assembler code,
you will probably have to list the register after the third colon to
tell the compiler the register's value is modified.  In some assemblers,
the register names begin with <span class="samp">%</span>; to produce one <span class="samp">%</span> in the
assembler code, you must write <span class="samp">%%</span> in the input.

   <p>If your assembler instruction can alter the condition code register, add
<span class="samp">cc</span> to the list of clobbered registers.  GCC on some machines
represents the condition codes as a specific hardware register;
<span class="samp">cc</span> serves to name this register.  On other machines, the
condition code is handled differently, and specifying <span class="samp">cc</span> has no
effect.  But it is valid no matter what the machine.

   <p>If your assembler instructions access memory in an unpredictable
fashion, add <span class="samp">memory</span> to the list of clobbered registers.  This
will cause GCC to not keep memory values cached in registers across the
assembler instruction and not optimize stores or loads to that memory. 
You will also want to add the <code>volatile</code> keyword if the memory
affected is not listed in the inputs or outputs of the <code>asm</code>, as
the <span class="samp">memory</span> clobber does not count as a side-effect of the
<code>asm</code>.  If you know how large the accessed memory is, you can add
it as input or output but if this is not known, you should add
<span class="samp">memory</span>.  As an example, if you access ten bytes of a string, you
can use a memory input like:

<pre class="example">     {"m"( ({ struct { char x[10]; } *p = (void *)ptr ; *p; }) )}.
</pre>
   <p>Note that in the following example the memory input is necessary,
otherwise GCC might optimize the store to <code>x</code> away:
<pre class="example">     int foo ()
     {
       int x = 42;
       int *y = &amp;x;
       int result;
       asm ("magic stuff accessing an 'int' pointed to by '%1'"
             "=&amp;d" (r) : "a" (y), "m" (*y));
       return result;
     }
</pre>
   <p>You can put multiple assembler instructions together in a single
<code>asm</code> template, separated by the characters normally used in assembly
code for the system.  A combination that works in most places is a newline
to break the line, plus a tab character to move to the instruction field
(written as <span class="samp">\n\t</span>).  Sometimes semicolons can be used, if the
assembler allows semicolons as a line-breaking character.  Note that some
assembler dialects use semicolons to start a comment. 
The input operands are guaranteed not to use any of the clobbered
registers, and neither will the output operands' addresses, so you can
read and write the clobbered registers as many times as you like.  Here
is an example of multiple instructions in a template; it assumes the
subroutine <code>_foo</code> accepts arguments in registers 9 and 10:

<pre class="example">     asm ("movl %0,r9\n\tmovl %1,r10\n\tcall _foo"
          : /* no outputs */
          : "g" (from), "g" (to)
          : "r9", "r10");
</pre>
   <p>Unless an output operand has the <span class="samp">&amp;</span> constraint modifier, GCC
may allocate it in the same register as an unrelated input operand, on
the assumption the inputs are consumed before the outputs are produced. 
This assumption may be false if the assembler code actually consists of
more than one instruction.  In such a case, use <span class="samp">&amp;</span> for each output
operand that may not overlap an input.  See <a href="#Modifiers">Modifiers</a>.

   <p>If you want to test the condition code produced by an assembler
instruction, you must include a branch and a label in the <code>asm</code>
construct, as follows:

<pre class="example">     asm ("clr %0\n\tfrob %1\n\tbeq 0f\n\tmov #1,%0\n0:"
          : "g" (result)
          : "g" (input));
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This assumes your assembler supports local labels, as the GNU assembler
and most Unix assemblers do.

   <p>Speaking of labels, jumps from one <code>asm</code> to another are not
supported.  The compiler's optimizers do not know about these jumps, and
therefore they cannot take account of them when deciding how to
optimize.

   <p><a name="index-macros-containing-_0040code_007basm_007d-1695"></a>Usually the most convenient way to use these <code>asm</code> instructions is to
encapsulate them in macros that look like functions.  For example,

<pre class="example">     #define sin(x)       \
     ({ double __value, __arg = (x);   \
        asm ("fsinx %1,%0": "=f" (__value): "f" (__arg));  \
        __value; })
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here the variable <code>__arg</code> is used to make sure that the instruction
operates on a proper <code>double</code> value, and to accept only those
arguments <code>x</code> which can convert automatically to a <code>double</code>.

   <p>Another way to make sure the instruction operates on the correct data
type is to use a cast in the <code>asm</code>.  This is different from using a
variable <code>__arg</code> in that it converts more different types.  For
example, if the desired type were <code>int</code>, casting the argument to
<code>int</code> would accept a pointer with no complaint, while assigning the
argument to an <code>int</code> variable named <code>__arg</code> would warn about
using a pointer unless the caller explicitly casts it.

   <p>If an <code>asm</code> has output operands, GCC assumes for optimization
purposes the instruction has no side effects except to change the output
operands.  This does not mean instructions with a side effect cannot be
used, but you must be careful, because the compiler may eliminate them
if the output operands aren't used, or move them out of loops, or
replace two with one if they constitute a common subexpression.  Also,
if your instruction does have a side effect on a variable that otherwise
appears not to change, the old value of the variable may be reused later
if it happens to be found in a register.

   <p>You can prevent an <code>asm</code> instruction from being deleted, moved
significantly, or combined, by writing the keyword <code>volatile</code> after
the <code>asm</code>.  For example:

<pre class="example">     #define get_and_set_priority(new)              \
     ({ int __old;                                  \
        asm volatile ("get_and_set_priority %0, %1" \
                      : "=g" (__old) : "g" (new));  \
        __old; })
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you write an <code>asm</code> instruction with no outputs, GCC will know
the instruction has side-effects and will not delete the instruction or
move it outside of loops.

   <p>The <code>volatile</code> keyword indicates that the instruction has
important side-effects.  GCC will not delete a volatile <code>asm</code> if
it is reachable.  (The instruction can still be deleted if GCC can
prove that control-flow will never reach the location of the
instruction.)  In addition, GCC will not reschedule instructions
across a volatile <code>asm</code> instruction.  For example:

<pre class="example">     *(volatile int *)addr = foo;
     asm volatile ("eieio" : : );
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Assume <code>addr</code> contains the address of a memory mapped device
register.  The PowerPC <code>eieio</code> instruction (Enforce In-order
Execution of I/O) tells the CPU to make sure that the store to that
device register happens before it issues any other I/O.

   <p>Note that even a volatile <code>asm</code> instruction can be moved in ways
that appear insignificant to the compiler, such as across jump
instructions.  You can't expect a sequence of volatile <code>asm</code>
instructions to remain perfectly consecutive.  If you want consecutive
output, use a single <code>asm</code>.  Also, GCC will perform some
optimizations across a volatile <code>asm</code> instruction; GCC does not
&ldquo;forget everything&rdquo; when it encounters a volatile <code>asm</code>
instruction the way some other compilers do.

   <p>An <code>asm</code> instruction without any operands or clobbers (an &ldquo;old
style&rdquo; <code>asm</code>) will be treated identically to a volatile
<code>asm</code> instruction.

   <p>It is a natural idea to look for a way to give access to the condition
code left by the assembler instruction.  However, when we attempted to
implement this, we found no way to make it work reliably.  The problem
is that output operands might need reloading, which would result in
additional following &ldquo;store&rdquo; instructions.  On most machines, these
instructions would alter the condition code before there was time to
test it.  This problem doesn't arise for ordinary &ldquo;test&rdquo; and
&ldquo;compare&rdquo; instructions because they don't have any output operands.

   <p>For reasons similar to those described above, it is not possible to give
an assembler instruction access to the condition code left by previous
instructions.

   <p>If you are writing a header file that should be includable in ISO C
programs, write <code>__asm__</code> instead of <code>asm</code>.  See <a href="#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">5.35.1 i386 floating point asm operands</h4>

<p>There are several rules on the usage of stack-like regs in
asm_operands insns.  These rules apply only to the operands that are
stack-like regs:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Given a set of input regs that die in an asm_operands, it is
necessary to know which are implicitly popped by the asm, and
which must be explicitly popped by gcc.

     <p>An input reg that is implicitly popped by the asm must be
explicitly clobbered, unless it is constrained to match an
output operand.

     <li>For any input reg that is implicitly popped by an asm, it is
necessary to know how to adjust the stack to compensate for the pop. 
If any non-popped input is closer to the top of the reg-stack than
the implicitly popped reg, it would not be possible to know what the
stack looked like&mdash;it's not clear how the rest of the stack &ldquo;slides
up&rdquo;.

     <p>All implicitly popped input regs must be closer to the top of
the reg-stack than any input that is not implicitly popped.

     <p>It is possible that if an input dies in an insn, reload might
use the input reg for an output reload.  Consider this example:

     <pre class="example">          asm ("foo" : "=t" (a) : "f" (b));
     </pre>
     <p>This asm says that input B is not popped by the asm, and that
the asm pushes a result onto the reg-stack, i.e., the stack is one
deeper after the asm than it was before.  But, it is possible that
reload will think that it can use the same reg for both the input and
the output, if input B dies in this insn.

     <p>If any input operand uses the <code>f</code> constraint, all output reg
constraints must use the <code>&amp;</code> earlyclobber.

     <p>The asm above would be written as

     <pre class="example">          asm ("foo" : "=&amp;t" (a) : "f" (b));
     </pre>
     <li>Some operands need to be in particular places on the stack.  All
output operands fall in this category&mdash;there is no other way to
know which regs the outputs appear in unless the user indicates
this in the constraints.

     <p>Output operands must specifically indicate which reg an output
appears in after an asm.  <code>=f</code> is not allowed: the operand
constraints must select a class with a single reg.

     <li>Output operands may not be &ldquo;inserted&rdquo; between existing stack regs. 
Since no 387 opcode uses a read/write operand, all output operands
are dead before the asm_operands, and are pushed by the asm_operands. 
It makes no sense to push anywhere but the top of the reg-stack.

     <p>Output operands must start at the top of the reg-stack: output
operands may not &ldquo;skip&rdquo; a reg.

     <li>Some asm statements may need extra stack space for internal
calculations.  This can be guaranteed by clobbering stack registers
unrelated to the inputs and outputs.

        </ol>

   <p>Here are a couple of reasonable asms to want to write.  This asm
takes one input, which is internally popped, and produces two outputs.

<pre class="example">     asm ("fsincos" : "=t" (cos), "=u" (sin) : "0" (inp));
</pre>
   <p>This asm takes two inputs, which are popped by the <code>fyl2xp1</code> opcode,
and replaces them with one output.  The user must code the <code>st(1)</code>
clobber for reg-stack.c to know that <code>fyl2xp1</code> pops both inputs.

<pre class="example">     asm ("fyl2xp1" : "=t" (result) : "0" (x), "u" (y) : "st(1)");
</pre>

Here are specific details on what constraint letters you can use with
<code>asm</code> operands. 
Constraints can say whether
an operand may be in a register, and which kinds of register; whether the
operand can be a memory reference, and which kinds of address; whether the
operand may be an immediate constant, and which possible values it may
have.  Constraints can also require two operands to match.

<h4 class="subsection">5.36.1 Simple Constraints</h4>

<p><a name="index-simple-constraints-1699"></a>
The simplest kind of constraint is a string full of letters, each of
which describes one kind of operand that is permitted.  Here are
the letters that are allowed:

     <dl>
<dt>whitespace<dd>Whitespace characters are ignored and can be inserted at any position
except the first.  This enables each alternative for different operands to
be visually aligned in the machine description even if they have different
number of constraints and modifiers.

     <p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bm_007d-in-constraint-1700"></a><a name="index-memory-references-in-constraints-1701"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">m</span><dd>A memory operand is allowed, with any kind of address that the machine
supports in general.

     <p><a name="index-offsettable-address-1702"></a><a name="index-_0040samp_007bo_007d-in-constraint-1703"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">o</span><dd>A memory operand is allowed, but only if the address is
<dfn>offsettable</dfn>.  This means that adding a small integer (actually,
the width in bytes of the operand, as determined by its machine mode)
may be added to the address and the result is also a valid memory
address.

     <p><a name="index-autoincrement_002fdecrement-addressing-1704"></a>For example, an address which is constant is offsettable; so is an
address that is the sum of a register and a constant (as long as a
slightly larger constant is also within the range of address-offsets
supported by the machine); but an autoincrement or autodecrement
address is not offsettable.  More complicated indirect/indexed
addresses may or may not be offsettable depending on the other
addressing modes that the machine supports.

     <p>Note that in an output operand which can be matched by another
operand, the constraint letter <span class="samp">o</span> is valid only when accompanied
by both <span class="samp">&lt;</span> (if the target machine has predecrement addressing)
and <span class="samp">&gt;</span> (if the target machine has preincrement addressing).

register.

This includes symbolic constants whose values will be known only at
assembly time.

     <p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bn_007d-in-constraint-1712"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">n</span><dd>An immediate integer operand with a known numeric value is allowed. 
Many systems cannot support assembly-time constants for operands less
than a word wide.  Constraints for these operands should use <span class="samp">n</span>
rather than <span class="samp">i</span>.

     <p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bI_007d-in-constraint-1713"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">I</span>, <span class="samp">J</span>, <span class="samp">K</span>, <small class="dots">...</small> <span class="samp">P</span><dd>Other letters in the range <span class="samp">I</span> through <span class="samp">P</span> may be defined in
a machine-dependent fashion to permit immediate integer operands with
explicit integer values in specified ranges.  For example, on the
68000, <span class="samp">I</span> is defined to stand for the range of values 1 to 8. 
This is the range permitted as a shift count in the shift
instructions.

     <p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bE_007d-in-constraint-1714"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">E</span><dd>An immediate floating operand (expression code <code>const_double</code>) is

     <p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bF_007d-in-constraint-1715"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">F</span><dd>An immediate floating operand (expression code <code>const_double</code> or

allowed.

     <p>This might appear strange; if an insn allows a constant operand with a
value not known at compile time, it certainly must allow any known
value.  So why use <span class="samp">s</span> instead of <span class="samp">i</span>?  Sometimes it allows
better code to be generated.

     <p>For example, on the 68000 in a fullword instruction it is possible to
use an immediate operand; but if the immediate value is between &minus;128
and 127, better code results from loading the value into a register and
using the register.  This is because the load into the register can be
done with a <span class="samp">moveq</span> instruction.  We arrange for this to happen
by defining the letter <span class="samp">K</span> to mean &ldquo;any integer outside the
range &minus;128 to 127&rdquo;, and then specifying <span class="samp">Ks</span> in the operand
constraints.

     <p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bg_007d-in-constraint-1719"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">g</span><dd>Any register, memory or immediate integer operand is allowed, except for
registers that are not general registers.

     <p><a name="index-_0040samp_007bX_007d-in-constraint-1720"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">X</span><dd>Any operand whatsoever is allowed.

If a
digit is used together with letters within the same alternative, the
digit should come last.

     <p>This number is allowed to be more than a single digit.  If multiple
digits are encountered consecutively, they are interpreted as a single
decimal integer.  There is scant chance for ambiguity, since to-date
it has never been desirable that <span class="samp">10</span> be interpreted as matching
either operand 1 <em>or</em> operand 0.  Should this be desired, one
can use multiple alternatives instead.

     <p><a name="index-matching-constraint-1723"></a><a name="index-constraint_002c-matching-1724"></a>This is called a <dfn>matching constraint</dfn> and what it really means is
that the assembler has only a single operand that fills two roles
which <code>asm</code> distinguishes.  For example, an add instruction uses
two input operands and an output operand, but on most CISC
machines an add instruction really has only two operands, one of them an
input-output operand:

     <pre class="smallexample">          addl #35,r12
     </pre>
     <p>Matching constraints are used in these circumstances. 
More precisely, the two operands that match must include one input-only
operand and one output-only operand.  Moreover, the digit must be a
smaller number than the number of the operand that uses it in the
constraint.

<h4 class="subsection">5.36.2 Multiple Alternative Constraints</h4>

<p><a name="index-multiple-alternative-constraints-1732"></a>
Sometimes a single instruction has multiple alternative sets of possible
operands.  For example, on the 68000, a logical-or instruction can combine
register or an immediate value into memory, or it can combine any kind of
operand into a register; but it cannot combine one memory location into
another.

   <p>These constraints are represented as multiple alternatives.  An alternative
can be described by a series of letters for each operand.  The overall
constraint for an operand is made from the letters for this operand
from the first alternative, a comma, the letters for this operand from
the second alternative, a comma, and so on until the last alternative.

<!-- FIXME Is this ? and ! stuff of use in asm()?  If not, hide unless INTERNAL -->
<p>If all the operands fit any one alternative, the instruction is valid. 
Otherwise, for each alternative, the compiler counts how many instructions
must be added to copy the operands so that that alternative applies. 
The alternative requiring the least copying is chosen.  If two alternatives
need the same amount of copying, the one that comes first is chosen. 
These choices can be altered with the <span class="samp">?</span> and <span class="samp">!</span> characters:

     
<a name="index-_0040samp_007b_003f_007d-in-constraint-1733"></a>
<a name="index-question-mark-1734"></a>
<dl><dt><code>?</code><dd>Disparage slightly the alternative that the <span class="samp">?</span> appears in,
as a choice when no alternative applies exactly.  The compiler regards
this alternative as one unit more costly for each <span class="samp">?</span> that appears
in it.

This alternative can still be used if it fits without reloading,
but if reloading is needed, some other alternative will be used.

Here are constraint modifier characters.

     
<a name="index-_0040samp_007b_003d_007d-in-constraint-1739"></a>
<dl><dt><span class="samp">=</span><dd>Means that this operand is write-only for this instruction: the previous
value is discarded and replaced by output data.

     <p><a name="index-_0040samp_007b_002b_007d-in-constraint-1740"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">+</span><dd>Means that this operand is both read and written by the instruction.

     <p>When the compiler fixes up the operands to satisfy the constraints,
it needs to know which operands are inputs to the instruction and
which are outputs from it.  <span class="samp">=</span> identifies an output; <span class="samp">+</span>
identifies an operand that is both input and output; all other operands
are assumed to be input only.

     <p>If you specify <span class="samp">=</span> or <span class="samp">+</span> in a constraint, you put it in the
first character of the constraint string.

     <p><a name="index-_0040samp_007b_0026_007d-in-constraint-1741"></a><a name="index-earlyclobber-operand-1742"></a><br><dt><span class="samp">&amp;</span><dd>Means (in a particular alternative) that this operand is an
<dfn>earlyclobber</dfn> operand, which is modified before the instruction is
finished using the input operands.  Therefore, this operand may not lie
in a register that is used as an input operand or as part of any memory
address.

     <p><span class="samp">&amp;</span> applies only to the alternative in which it is written.  In
constraints with multiple alternatives, sometimes one alternative
requires <span class="samp">&amp;</span> while others do not.  See, for example, the
<span class="samp">movdf</span> insn of the 68000.

     <p>An input operand can be tied to an earlyclobber operand if its only
use as an input occurs before the early result is written.  Adding
alternatives of this form often allows GCC to produce better code
when only some of the inputs can be affected by the earlyclobber. 
See, for example, the <span class="samp">mulsi3</span> insn of the ARM.

     <p><span class="samp">&amp;</span> does not obviate the need to write <span class="samp">=</span>.

the compiler may fail.

<p><a name="index-machine-specific-constraints-1746"></a><a name="index-constraints_002c-machine-specific-1747"></a>
Whenever possible, you should use the general-purpose constraint letters
in <code>asm</code> arguments, since they will convey meaning more readily to
people reading your code.  Failing that, use the constraint letters
that usually have very similar meanings across architectures.  The most
commonly used constraints are <span class="samp">m</span> and <span class="samp">r</span> (for memory and
general-purpose registers respectively; see <a href="#Simple-Constraints">Simple Constraints</a>), and
<span class="samp">I</span>, usually the letter indicating the most common
immediate-constant format.

   <p>For each machine architecture, the
<span class="file">config/</span><var>machine</var><span class="file">/</span><var>machine</var><span class="file">.h</span> file defines additional
constraints.  These constraints are used by the compiler itself for
instruction generation, as well as for <code>asm</code> statements; therefore,
some of the constraints are not particularly interesting for <code>asm</code>. 
The constraints are defined through these macros:

     <dl>
<dt><code>REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER</code><dd>Register class constraints (usually lower case).

     <br><dt><code>CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P</code><dd>Immediate constant constraints, for non-floating point constants of
word size or smaller precision (usually upper case).

     <br><dt><code>CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P</code><dd>Immediate constant constraints, for all floating point constants and for
constants of greater than word size precision (usually upper case).

     <br><dt><code>EXTRA_CONSTRAINT</code><dd>Special cases of registers or memory.  This macro is not required, and
is only defined for some machines. 
</dl>

   <p>Inspecting these macro definitions in the compiler source for your
machine is the best way to be certain you have the right constraints. 
However, here is a summary of the machine-dependent constraints
available on some particular machines.

<h3 class="section">5.37 Controlling Names Used in Assembler Code</h3>

<p><a name="index-assembler-names-for-identifiers-1748"></a><a name="index-names-used-in-assembler-code-1749"></a><a name="index-identifiers_002c-names-in-assembler-code-1750"></a>
You can specify the name to be used in the assembler code for a C
function or variable by writing the <code>asm</code> (or <code>__asm__</code>)
keyword after the declarator as follows:

<pre class="example">     int foo asm ("myfoo") = 2;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This specifies that the name to be used for the variable <code>foo</code> in
the assembler code should be <span class="samp">myfoo</span> rather than the usual
<span class="samp">_foo</span>.

   <p>On systems where an underscore is normally prepended to the name of a C
function or variable, this feature allows you to define names for the
linker that do not start with an underscore.

   <p>It does not make sense to use this feature with a non-static local
variable since such variables do not have assembler names.  If you are
trying to put the variable in a particular register, see <a href="#Explicit-Reg-Vars">Explicit Reg Vars</a>.  GCC presently accepts such code with a warning, but will
probably be changed to issue an error, rather than a warning, in the
future.

   <p>You cannot use <code>asm</code> in this way in a function <em>definition</em>; but
you can get the same effect by writing a declaration for the function
before its definition and putting <code>asm</code> there, like this:

<pre class="example">     extern func () asm ("FUNC");
     
     func (x, y)
          int x, y;
     /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
</pre>
   <p>It is up to you to make sure that the assembler names you choose do not
conflict with any other assembler symbols.  Also, you must not use a
register name; that would produce completely invalid assembler code.  GCC
does not as yet have the ability to store static variables in registers. 
Perhaps that will be added.

GNU C allows you to put a few global variables into specified hardware
registers.  You can also specify the register in which an ordinary
register variable should be allocated.

     <ul>
<li>Global register variables reserve registers throughout the program. 
This may be useful in programs such as programming language
interpreters which have a couple of global variables that are accessed
very often.

     <li>Local register variables in specific registers do not reserve the
registers.  The compiler's data flow analysis is capable of determining
where the specified registers contain live values, and where they are
available for other uses.  Stores into local register variables may be deleted
when they appear to be dead according to dataflow analysis.  References
to local register variables may be deleted or moved or simplified.

     <p>These local variables are sometimes convenient for use with the extended
<code>asm</code> feature (see <a href="#Extended-Asm">Extended Asm</a>), if you want to write one
output of the assembler instruction directly into a particular register. 
(This will work provided the register you specify fits the constraints
specified for that operand in the <code>asm</code>.)

<h4 class="subsection">5.38.1 Defining Global Register Variables</h4>

<p><a name="index-global-register-variables-1755"></a><a name="index-registers_002c-global-variables-in-1756"></a>
You can define a global register variable in GNU C like this:

<pre class="example">     register int *foo asm ("a5");
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here <code>a5</code> is the name of the register which should be used.  Choose a
register which is normally saved and restored by function calls on your
machine, so that library routines will not clobber it.

   <p>Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, so you would need to
conditionalize your program according to cpu type.  The register
<code>a5</code> would be a good choice on a 68000 for a variable of pointer
type.  On machines with register windows, be sure to choose a &ldquo;global&rdquo;
register that is not affected magically by the function call mechanism.

   <p>In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <code>%a5</code>.

   <p>Eventually there may be a way of asking the compiler to choose a register
automatically, but first we need to figure out how it should choose and
how to enable you to guide the choice.  No solution is evident.

   <p>Defining a global register variable in a certain register reserves that
register entirely for this use, at least within the current compilation. 
The register will not be allocated for any other purpose in the functions
in the current compilation.  The register will not be saved and restored by
these functions.  Stores into this register are never deleted even if they
would appear to be dead, but references may be deleted or moved or
simplified.

   <p>It is not safe to access the global register variables from signal
handlers, or from more than one thread of control, because the system
library routines may temporarily use the register for other things (unless
you recompile them specially for the task at hand).

   <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bqsort_007d_002c-and-global-register-variables-1757"></a>It is not safe for one function that uses a global register variable to
call another such function <code>foo</code> by way of a third function
<code>lose</code> that was compiled without knowledge of this variable (i.e. in a
different source file in which the variable wasn't declared).  This is
because <code>lose</code> might save the register and put some other value there. 
For example, you can't expect a global register variable to be available in
the comparison-function that you pass to <code>qsort</code>, since <code>qsort</code>
might have put something else in that register.  (If you are prepared to
recompile <code>qsort</code> with the same global register variable, you can
solve this problem.)

   <p>If you want to recompile <code>qsort</code> or other source files which do not
actually use your global register variable, so that they will not use that
register for any other purpose, then it suffices to specify the compiler
option <span class="option">-ffixed-</span><var>reg</var>.  You need not actually add a global
register declaration to their source code.

   <p>A function which can alter the value of a global register variable cannot
safely be called from a function compiled without this variable, because it
could clobber the value the caller expects to find there on return. 
Therefore, the function which is the entry point into the part of the
program that uses the global register variable must explicitly save and
restore the value which belongs to its caller.

   <p><a name="index-register-variable-after-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-1758"></a><a name="index-global-register-after-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-1759"></a><a name="index-value-after-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-1760"></a><a name="index-longjmp-1761"></a><a name="index-setjmp-1762"></a>On most machines, <code>longjmp</code> will restore to each global register
variable the value it had at the time of the <code>setjmp</code>.  On some
machines, however, <code>longjmp</code> will not change the value of global
register variables.  To be portable, the function that called <code>setjmp</code>
should make other arrangements to save the values of the global register
variables, and to restore them in a <code>longjmp</code>.  This way, the same
thing will happen regardless of what <code>longjmp</code> does.

   <p>All global register variable declarations must precede all function
definitions.  If such a declaration could appear after function
definitions, the declaration would be too late to prevent the register from
being used for other purposes in the preceding functions.

   <p>Global register variables may not have initial values, because an
executable file has no means to supply initial contents for a register.

   <p>On the SPARC, there are reports that g3 <small class="dots">...</small> g7 are suitable
registers, but certain library functions, such as <code>getwd</code>, as well
as the subroutines for division and remainder, modify g3 and g4.  g1 and
g2 are local temporaries.

   <p>On the 68000, a2 <small class="dots">...</small> a5 should be suitable, as should d2 <small class="dots">...</small> d7. 
Of course, it will not do to use more than a few of those.

<h4 class="subsection">5.38.2 Specifying Registers for Local Variables</h4>

You can define a local register variable with a specified register
like this:

<pre class="example">     register int *foo asm ("a5");
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here <code>a5</code> is the name of the register which should be used.  Note
that this is the same syntax used for defining global register
variables, but for a local variable it would appear within a function.

   <p>Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, but this is not a
problem, since specific registers are most often useful with explicit
assembler instructions (see <a href="#Extended-Asm">Extended Asm</a>).  Both of these things
generally require that you conditionalize your program according to
cpu type.

   <p>In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <code>%a5</code>.

   <p>Defining such a register variable does not reserve the register; it
remains available for other uses in places where flow control determines
the variable's value is not live.  However, these registers are made
unavailable for use in the reload pass; excessive use of this feature
leaves the compiler too few available registers to compile certain
functions.

   <p>This option does not guarantee that GCC will generate code that has
this variable in the register you specify at all times.  You may not
code an explicit reference to this register in an <code>asm</code> statement
and assume it will always refer to this variable.

   <p>Stores into local register variables may be deleted when they appear to be dead
according to dataflow analysis.  References to local register variables may
be deleted or moved or simplified.

<h3 class="section">5.39 Alternate Keywords</h3>

<p><a name="index-alternate-keywords-1766"></a><a name="index-keywords_002c-alternate-1767"></a>
<span class="option">-ansi</span> and the various <span class="option">-std</span> options disable certain
keywords.  This causes trouble when you want to use GNU C extensions, or
a general-purpose header file that should be usable by all programs,
including ISO C programs.  The keywords <code>asm</code>, <code>typeof</code> and
<code>inline</code> are not available in programs compiled with
<span class="option">-ansi</span> or <span class="option">-std</span> (although <code>inline</code> can be used in a
program compiled with <span class="option">-std=c99</span>).  The ISO C99 keyword
<code>restrict</code> is only available when <span class="option">-std=gnu99</span> (which will
eventually be the default) or <span class="option">-std=c99</span> (or the equivalent
<span class="option">-std=iso9899:1999</span>) is used.

   <p>The way to solve these problems is to put <span class="samp">__</span> at the beginning and
end of each problematical keyword.  For example, use <code>__asm__</code>
instead of <code>asm</code>, and <code>__inline__</code> instead of <code>inline</code>.

   <p>Other C compilers won't accept these alternative keywords; if you want to
compile with another compiler, you can define the alternate keywords as
macros to replace them with the customary keywords.  It looks like this:

<pre class="example">     #ifndef __GNUC__
     #define __asm__ asm
     #endif
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-_005f_005fextension_005f_005f-1768"></a><a name="index-pedantic-1769"></a><span class="option">-pedantic</span> and other options cause warnings for many GNU C extensions. 
You can
prevent such warnings within one expression by writing
<code>__extension__</code> before the expression.  <code>__extension__</code> has no
effect aside from this.

<h3 class="section">5.40 Incomplete <code>enum</code> Types</h3>

<p>You can define an <code>enum</code> tag without specifying its possible values. 
This results in an incomplete type, much like what you get if you write
<code>struct foo</code> without describing the elements.  A later declaration
which does specify the possible values completes the type.

   <p>You can't allocate variables or storage using the type while it is
incomplete.  However, you can work with pointers to that type.

   <p>This extension may not be very useful, but it makes the handling of
<code>enum</code> more consistent with the way <code>struct</code> and <code>union</code>
are handled.

   <p>This extension is not supported by GNU C++.

GCC predefines two magic identifiers to hold the name of the current
function.  The identifier <code>__FUNCTION__</code> holds the name of the function
as it appears in the source.  The identifier <code>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</code>
holds the name of the function pretty printed in a language specific
fashion.

   <p>These names are always the same in a C function, but in a C++ function
they may be different.  For example, this program:

<pre class="smallexample">     extern "C" {
     extern int printf (char *, ...);
     }
     
     class a {
      public:
       sub (int i)
         {
           printf ("__FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __FUNCTION__);
           printf ("__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = %s\n", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
         }
     };
     
     int
     main (void)
     {
       a ax;
       ax.sub (0);
       return 0;
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">gives this output:

<pre class="smallexample">     __FUNCTION__ = sub
     __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ = int  a::sub (int)
</pre>
   <p>The compiler automagically replaces the identifiers with a string
literal containing the appropriate name.  Thus, they are neither
preprocessor macros, like <code>__FILE__</code> and <code>__LINE__</code>, nor
variables.  This means that they catenate with other string literals, and
that they can be used to initialize char arrays.  For example

<pre class="smallexample">     char here[] = "Function " __FUNCTION__ " in " __FILE__;
</pre>
   <p>On the other hand, <span class="samp">#ifdef __FUNCTION__</span> does not have any special
meaning inside a function, since the preprocessor does not do anything
special with the identifier <code>__FUNCTION__</code>.

   <p>Note that these semantics are deprecated, and that GCC 3.2 will handle
<code>__FUNCTION__</code> and <code>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</code> the same way as
<code>__func__</code>.  <code>__func__</code> is defined by the ISO standard C99:

<pre class="display">     The identifier <code>__func__</code> is implicitly declared by the translator
     as if, immediately following the opening brace of each function
     definition, the declaration
     <pre class="smallexample">          static const char __func__[] = "function-name";
     </pre>
     
     <p>appeared, where function-name is the name of the lexically-enclosing
     function.  This name is the unadorned name of the function.
</pre>
   <p>By this definition, <code>__func__</code> is a variable, not a string literal. 
In particular, <code>__func__</code> does not catenate with other string
literals.

   <p>In <code>C++</code>, <code>__FUNCTION__</code> and <code>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</code> are
variables, declared in the same way as <code>__func__</code>.

of the caller of the current function, and so forth. When inlining

the function that will be returned to.  To work around this behavior use
the <code>noinline</code> function attribute.

<h3 class="section">5.43 Using vector instructions through built-in functions</h3>

<p>On some targets, the instruction set contains SIMD vector instructions that
operate on multiple values contained in one large register at the same time. 
For example, on the i386 the MMX, 3Dnow! and SSE extensions can be used
this way.

   <p>The first step in using these extensions is to provide the necessary data
types.  This should be done using an appropriate <code>typedef</code>:

<pre class="example">     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((mode(V4SI)));
</pre>
   <p>The base type <code>int</code> is effectively ignored by the compiler, the
actual properties of the new type <code>v4si</code> are defined by the
<code>__attribute__</code>.  It defines the machine mode to be used; for vector
types these have the form <code>V</code><var>n</var><var>B</var>; <var>n</var> should be the
number of elements in the vector, and <var>B</var> should be the base mode of the
individual elements.  The following can be used as base modes:

     <dl>
<dt><code>QI</code><dd>An integer that is as wide as the smallest addressable unit, usually 8 bits. 
<br><dt><code>HI</code><dd>An integer, twice as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 16 bits. 
<br><dt><code>SI</code><dd>An integer, four times as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 32 bits. 
<br><dt><code>DI</code><dd>An integer, eight times as wide as a QI mode integer, usually 64 bits. 
<br><dt><code>SF</code><dd>A floating point value, as wide as a SI mode integer, usually 32 bits. 
<br><dt><code>DF</code><dd>A floating point value, as wide as a DI mode integer, usually 64 bits. 
</dl>

   <p>Specifying a combination that is not valid for the current architecture
will cause gcc to synthesize the instructions using a narrower mode. 
For example, if you specify a variable of type <code>V4SI</code> and your
architecture does not allow for this specific SIMD type, gcc will
produce code that uses 4 <code>SIs</code>.

   <p>The types defined in this manner can be used with a subset of normal C
operations.  Currently, gcc will allow using the following operators on
these types: <code>+, -, *, /, unary minus</code>.

   <p>The operations behave like C++ <code>valarrays</code>.  Addition is defined as
the addition of the corresponding elements of the operands.  For
example, in the code below, each of the 4 elements in <var>a</var> will be
added to the corresponding 4 elements in <var>b</var> and the resulting
vector will be stored in <var>c</var>.

<pre class="example">     typedef int v4si __attribute__ ((mode(V4SI)));
     
     v4si a, b, c;
     
     c = a + b;
</pre>
   <p>Subtraction, multiplication, and division operate in a similar manner. 
Likewise, the result of using the unary minus operator on a vector type
is a vector whose elements are the negative value of the corresponding
elements in the operand.

   <p>You can declare variables and use them in function calls and returns, as
well as in assignments and some casts.  You can specify a vector type as
a return type for a function.  Vector types can also be used as function
arguments.  It is possible to cast from one vector type to another,
provided they are of the same size (in fact, you can also cast vectors
to and from other datatypes of the same size).

   <p>You cannot operate between vectors of different lengths or different
signedness without a cast.

   <p>A port that supports hardware vector operations, usually provides a set
of built-in functions that can be used to operate on vectors.  For
example, a function to add two vectors and multiply the result by a
third could look like this:

<pre class="example">     v4si f (v4si a, v4si b, v4si c)
     {
       v4si tmp = __builtin_addv4si (a, b);
       return __builtin_mulv4si (tmp, c);
     }
     
</pre>

GCC provides a large number of built-in functions other than the ones
mentioned above.  Some of these are for internal use in the processing
of exceptions or variable-length argument lists and will not be
documented here because they may change from time to time; we do not
recommend general use of these functions.

   <p>The remaining functions are provided for optimization purposes.

   <p><a name="index-fno_002dbuiltin-1856"></a>GCC includes built-in versions of many of the functions in the standard
C library.  The versions prefixed with <code>__builtin_</code> will always be
treated as having the same meaning as the C library function even if you
specify the <span class="option">-fno-builtin</span> option. (see <a href="#C-Dialect-Options">C Dialect Options</a>)
Many of these functions are only optimized in certain cases; if they are
not optimized in a particular case, a call to the library function will
be emitted.

   <p><a name="index-ansi-1857"></a><a name="index-std-1858"></a>The functions <code>abort</code>, <code>exit</code>, <code>_Exit</code> and <code>_exit</code>
are recognized and presumed not to return, but otherwise are not built
in.  <code>_exit</code> is not recognized in strict ISO C mode (<span class="option">-ansi</span>,
<span class="option">-std=c89</span> or <span class="option">-std=c99</span>).  <code>_Exit</code> is not recognized in
strict C89 mode (<span class="option">-ansi</span> or <span class="option">-std=c89</span>).  All these functions
have corresponding versions prefixed with <code>__builtin_</code>, which may be
used even in strict C89 mode.

   <p>Outside strict ISO C mode, the functions <code>alloca</code>, <code>bcmp</code>,
<code>bzero</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>rindex</code>, <code>ffs</code>, <code>fputs_unlocked</code>,
<code>printf_unlocked</code> and <code>fprintf_unlocked</code> may be handled as
built-in functions.  All these functions have corresponding versions
prefixed with <code>__builtin_</code>, which may be used even in strict C89
mode.

   <p>The ISO C99 functions <code>conj</code>, <code>conjf</code>, <code>conjl</code>,
<code>creal</code>, <code>crealf</code>, <code>creall</code>, <code>cimag</code>, <code>cimagf</code>,
<code>cimagl</code>, <code>imaxabs</code>, <code>llabs</code>, <code>snprintf</code>,
<code>vscanf</code>, <code>vsnprintf</code> and <code>vsscanf</code> are handled as built-in
functions except in strict ISO C90 mode.  There are also built-in
versions of the ISO C99 functions <code>cosf</code>, <code>cosl</code>,
<code>expf</code>, <code>expl</code>, <code>fabsf</code>, <code>fabsl</code>,
<code>logf</code>, <code>logl</code>, <code>sinf</code>, <code>sinl</code>, <code>sqrtf</code>, and
<code>sqrtl</code>, that are recognized in any mode since ISO C90 reserves
these names for the purpose to which ISO C99 puts them.  All these
functions have corresponding versions prefixed with <code>__builtin_</code>.

   <p>The ISO C90 functions <code>abs</code>, <code>cos</code>, <code>exp</code>, <code>fabs</code>,
<code>fprintf</code>, <code>fputs</code>, <code>labs</code>, <code>log</code>,
<code>memcmp</code>, <code>memcpy</code>,
<code>memset</code>, <code>printf</code>, <code>putchar</code>, <code>puts</code>, <code>scanf</code>,
<code>sin</code>, <code>snprintf</code>, <code>sprintf</code>, <code>sqrt</code>, <code>sscanf</code>,
<code>strcat</code>,
<code>strchr</code>, <code>strcmp</code>, <code>strcpy</code>, <code>strcspn</code>,
<code>strlen</code>, <code>strncat</code>, <code>strncmp</code>, <code>strncpy</code>,
<code>strpbrk</code>, <code>strrchr</code>, <code>strspn</code>, <code>strstr</code>,
<code>vprintf</code> and <code>vsprintf</code> are all
recognized as built-in functions unless <span class="option">-fno-builtin</span> is
specified (or <span class="option">-fno-builtin-</span><var>function</var> is specified for an
individual function).  All of these functions have corresponding
versions prefixed with <code>__builtin_</code>.

   <p>GCC provides built-in versions of the ISO C99 floating point comparison
macros that avoid raising exceptions for unordered operands.  They have
the same names as the standard macros ( <code>isgreater</code>,
<code>isgreaterequal</code>, <code>isless</code>, <code>islessequal</code>,
<code>islessgreater</code>, and <code>isunordered</code>) , with <code>__builtin_</code>
prefixed.  We intend for a library implementor to be able to simply
<code>#define</code> each standard macro to its built-in equivalent.

        <p>This built-in function returns 1 if the unqualified versions of the
types <var>type1</var> and <var>type2</var> (which are types, not expressions) are
compatible, 0 otherwise.  The result of this built-in function can be
used in integer constant expressions.

        <p>This built-in function ignores top level qualifiers (e.g., <code>const</code>,
<code>volatile</code>).  For example, <code>int</code> is equivalent to <code>const
int</code>.

        <p>The type <code>int[]</code> and <code>int[5]</code> are compatible.  On the other
hand, <code>int</code> and <code>char *</code> are not compatible, even if the size
of their types, on the particular architecture are the same.  Also, the
amount of pointer indirection is taken into account when determining
similarity.  Consequently, <code>short *</code> is not similar to
<code>short **</code>.  Furthermore, two types that are typedefed are
considered compatible if their underlying types are compatible.

        <p>An <code>enum</code> type is considered to be compatible with another
<code>enum</code> type.  For example, <code>enum {foo, bar}</code> is similar to
<code>enum {hot, dog}</code>.

<blockquote><p>You can use the built-in function <code>__builtin_constant_p</code> to
determine if a value is known to be constant at compile-time and hence
that GCC can perform constant-folding on expressions involving that
value.  The argument of the function is the value to test.  The function
returns the integer 1 if the argument is known to be a compile-time
constant and 0 if it is not known to be a compile-time constant.  A
return of 0 does not indicate that the value is <em>not</em> a constant,
but merely that GCC cannot prove it is a constant with the specified
value of the <span class="option">-O</span> option.

        <p>You would typically use this function in an embedded application where
memory was a critical resource.  If you have some complex calculation,
you may want it to be folded if it involves constants, but need to call
a function if it does not.  For example:

     <pre class="smallexample">          #define Scale_Value(X)      \
            (__builtin_constant_p (X) \

        <p>You may use this built-in function in either a macro or an inline
function.  However, if you use it in an inlined function and pass an
argument of the function as the argument to the built-in, GCC will
never return 1 when you call the inline function with a string constant
or compound literal (see <a href="#Compound-Literals">Compound Literals</a>) and will not return 1
when you pass a constant numeric value to the inline function unless you
specify the <span class="option">-O</span> option.

        <p>You may also use <code>__builtin_constant_p</code> in initializers for static
data.  For instance, you can write

     <pre class="smallexample">          static const int table[] = {

             /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
          };
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">This is an acceptable initializer even if <var>EXPRESSION</var> is not a
constant expression.  GCC must be more conservative about evaluating the
built-in in this case, because it has no opportunity to perform
optimization.

initializers.  The earliest version where it is completely safe is

<blockquote><p>This function is used to minimize cache-miss latency by moving data into
a cache before it is accessed. 
You can insert calls to <code>__builtin_prefetch</code> into code for which
you know addresses of data in memory that is likely to be accessed soon. 
If the target supports them, data prefetch instructions will be generated. 
If the prefetch is done early enough before the access then the data will
be in the cache by the time it is accessed.

        <p>The value of <var>addr</var> is the address of the memory to prefetch. 
There are two optional arguments, <var>rw</var> and <var>locality</var>. 
The value of <var>rw</var> is a compile-time constant one or zero; one
means that the prefetch is preparing for a write to the memory address
and zero, the default, means that the prefetch is preparing for a read. 
The value <var>locality</var> must be a compile-time constant integer between
zero and three.  A value of zero means that the data has no temporal
locality, so it need not be left in the cache after the access.  A value
of three means that the data has a high degree of temporal locality and
should be left in all levels of cache possible.  Values of one and two
mean, respectively, a low or moderate degree of temporal locality.  The
default is three.

     <pre class="smallexample">          for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
            {
              a[i] = a[i] + b[i];
              __builtin_prefetch (&amp;a[i+j], 1, 1);
              __builtin_prefetch (&amp;b[i+j], 0, 1);
              /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
            }
     </pre>
        <p>Data prefetch does not generate faults if <var>addr</var> is invalid, but
the address expression itself must be valid.  For example, a prefetch
of <code>p-&gt;next</code> will not fault if <code>p-&gt;next</code> is not a valid
address, but evaluation will fault if <code>p</code> is not a valid address.

        <p>If the target does not support data prefetch, the address expression
is evaluated if it includes side effects but no other code is generated
and GCC does not issue a warning.

<h4 class="subsection">5.45.3 PowerPC AltiVec Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>These built-in functions are available for the PowerPC family
of computers, depending on the command-line switches used.

   <p>The following machine modes are available for use with AltiVec built-in
functions (see <a href="#Vector-Extensions">Vector Extensions</a>): <code>V4SI</code> for a vector of four
32-bit integers, <code>V4SF</code> for a vector of four 32-bit floating point
numbers, <code>V8HI</code> for a vector of eight 16-bit integers, and
<code>V16QI</code> for a vector of sixteen 8-bit integers.

   <p>The following functions are made available by including
<code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> and using <span class="option">-maltivec</span> and
<span class="option">-mabi=altivec</span>.  The functions implement the functionality
described in Motorola's AltiVec Programming Interface Manual.

   <p>There are a few differences from Motorola's documentation and GCC's
implementation.  Vector constants are done with curly braces (not
parentheses).  Vector initializers require no casts if the vector
constant is of the same type as the variable it is initializing.  The
<code>vector bool</code> type is deprecated and will be discontinued in
further revisions.  Use <code>vector signed</code> instead.  If <code>signed</code>
or <code>unsigned</code> is omitted, the vector type will default to
<code>signed</code>.  Lastly, all overloaded functions are implemented with macros
for the C implementation.  So code the following example will not work:

<pre class="smallexample">       vec_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);
</pre>
   <p>Since vec_add is a macro, the vector constant in the above example will
be treated as four different arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
parentheses for this to work.  The C++ implementation does not use
macros.

   <p><em>Note:</em> Only the <code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> interface is supported. 
Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to achieve the functionality in
the aforementioned header file, but they are not supported and are
subject to change without notice.

<h3 class="section">5.46 Pragmas Accepted by GCC</h3>

<p><a name="index-pragmas-1877"></a><a name="index-_0023pragma-1878"></a>
GCC supports several types of pragmas, primarily in order to compile
code originally written for other compilers.  Note that in general
we do not recommend the use of pragmas; See <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>,
for further explanation.

See <a href="#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>, for information about the effects of these
attributes.

     <dl>

<h4 class="subsection">5.46.3 Darwin Pragmas</h4>

<p>The following pragmas are available for all architectures running the

Mac OS compilers.

     <dl>
<dt><code>mark </code><var>tokens</var><code>...</code><dd><a name="index-pragma_002c-mark-1883"></a>This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

     <br><dt><code>options align=</code><var>alignment</var><dd><a name="index-pragma_002c-options-align-1884"></a>This pragma sets the alignment of fields in structures.  The values of
<var>alignment</var> may be <code>mac68k</code>, to emulate m68k alignment, or
<code>power</code>, to emulate PowerPC alignment.  Uses of this pragma nest
properly; to restore the previous setting, use <code>reset</code> for the
<var>alignment</var>.

     <br><dt><code>segment </code><var>tokens</var><code>...</code><dd><a name="index-pragma_002c-segment-1885"></a>This pragma is accepted, but has no effect.

     <br><dt><code>unused (</code><var>var</var><code> [, </code><var>var</var><code>]...)</code><dd><a name="index-pragma_002c-unused-1886"></a>This pragma declares variables to be possibly unused.  GCC will not

<dt><code>redefine_extname </code><var>oldname</var> <var>newname</var><dd><a name="index-pragma_002c-redefine_005fextname-1887"></a>
This pragma gives the C function <var>oldname</var> the assembler label
<var>newname</var>.  The pragma must appear before the function declaration. 
This pragma is equivalent to the asm labels extension (see <a href="#Asm-Labels">Asm Labels</a>).  The preprocessor defines <code>__PRAGMA_REDEFINE_EXTNAME</code>

<dt><code>extern_prefix </code><var>string</var><dd><a name="index-pragma_002c-extern_005fprefix-1888"></a>
This pragma renames all subsequent function and variable declarations
such that <var>string</var> is prepended to the name.  This effect may be
terminated by using another <code>extern_prefix</code> pragma with the
empty string.

     <p>This pragma is similar in intent to to the asm labels extension
(see <a href="#Asm-Labels">Asm Labels</a>) in that the system programmer wants to change
the assembly-level ABI without changing the source-level API.  The
preprocessor defines <code>__PRAGMA_EXTERN_PREFIX</code> if the pragma is
available.

<h3 class="section">5.47 Unnamed struct/union fields within structs/unions.</h3>

<p><a name="index-struct-1889"></a><a name="index-union-1890"></a>
For compatibility with other compilers, GCC allows you to define
a structure or union that contains, as fields, structures and unions
without names.  For example:

<pre class="example">     struct {
       int a;
       union {
         int b;
         float c;
       };
       int d;
     } foo;
</pre>
   <p>In this example, the user would be able to access members of the unnamed
union with code like <span class="samp">foo.b</span>.  Note that only unnamed structs and
unions are allowed, you may not have, for example, an unnamed
<code>int</code>.

   <p>You must never create such structures that cause ambiguous field definitions. 
For example, this structure:

<pre class="example">     struct {
       int a;
       struct {
         int a;
       };
     } foo;
</pre>
   <p>It is ambiguous which <code>a</code> is being referred to with <span class="samp">foo.a</span>. 
Such constructs are not supported and must be avoided.  In the future,
such constructs may be detected and treated as compilation errors.

<h3 class="section">5.48 Thread-Local Storage</h3>

<p><a name="index-Thread_002dLocal-Storage-1891"></a><a name="index-_0040acronym_007bTLS_007d-1892"></a><a name="index-_005f_005fthread-1893"></a>
Thread-local storage (<acronym>TLS</acronym>) is a mechanism by which variables
are allocated such that there is one instance of the variable per extant
thread.  The run-time model GCC uses to implement this originates
in the IA-64 processor-specific ABI, but has since been migrated
to other processors as well.  It requires significant support from
the linker (<span class="command">ld</span>), dynamic linker (<span class="command">ld.so</span>), and
system libraries (<span class="file">libc.so</span> and <span class="file">libpthread.so</span>), so it
is not available everywhere.

   <p>At the user level, the extension is visible with a new storage
class keyword: <code>__thread</code>.  For example:

<pre class="example">     __thread int i;
     extern __thread struct state s;
     static __thread char *p;
</pre>
   <p>The <code>__thread</code> specifier may be used alone, with the <code>extern</code>
or <code>static</code> specifiers, but with no other storage class specifier. 
When used with <code>extern</code> or <code>static</code>, <code>__thread</code> must appear
immediately after the other storage class specifier.

   <p>The <code>__thread</code> specifier may be applied to any global, file-scoped
static, function-scoped static, or static data member of a class.  It may
not be applied to block-scoped automatic or non-static data member.

   <p>When the address-of operator is applied to a thread-local variable, it is
evaluated at run-time and returns the address of the current thread's
instance of that variable.  An address so obtained may be used by any
thread.  When a thread terminates, any pointers to thread-local variables
in that thread become invalid.

   <p>No static initialization may refer to the address of a thread-local variable.

   <p>In C++, if an initializer is present for a thread-local variable, it must
be a <var>constant-expression</var>, as defined in 5.19.2 of the ANSI/ISO C++
standard.

   <p>See <a href="http://people.redhat.com/drepper/tls.pdf">ELF Handling For Thread-Local Storage</a> for a detailed explanation of
the four thread-local storage addressing models, and how the run-time
is expected to function.

The GNU compiler provides these extensions to the C++ language (and you
can also use most of the C language extensions in your C++ programs).  If you
want to write code that checks whether these features are available, you can
test for the GNU compiler the same way as for C programs: check for a
predefined macro <code>__GNUC__</code>.  You can also use <code>__GNUG__</code> to
test specifically for GNU C++ (see <a href="{No value for `fncpp'}.html#Common-Predefined-Macros">Predefined Macros (The GNU C Preprocessor)</a>).

<h3 class="section">6.1 Minimum and Maximum Operators in C++</h3>

<p>It is very convenient to have operators which return the &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;maximum&rdquo; of two arguments.  In GNU C++ (but not in GNU C),

     <dl>
<dt><var>a</var><code> &lt;? </code><var>b</var><dd><a name="index-_003c_003f-1896"></a><a name="index-minimum-operator-1897"></a>is the <dfn>minimum</dfn>, returning the smaller of the numeric values
<var>a</var> and <var>b</var>;

     <br><dt><var>a</var><code> &gt;? </code><var>b</var><dd><a name="index-_003e_003f-1898"></a><a name="index-maximum-operator-1899"></a>is the <dfn>maximum</dfn>, returning the larger of the numeric values <var>a</var>
and <var>b</var>. 
</dl>

   <p>These operations are not primitive in ordinary C++, since you can
use a macro to return the minimum of two things in C++, as in the
following example.

<pre class="example">     #define MIN(X,Y) ((X) &lt; (Y) ? : (X) : (Y))

<h3 class="section">6.2 When is a Volatile Object Accessed?</h3>

<p><a name="index-accessing-volatiles-1900"></a><a name="index-volatile-read-1901"></a><a name="index-volatile-write-1902"></a><a name="index-volatile-access-1903"></a>
Both the C and C++ standard have the concept of volatile objects.  These
are normally accessed by pointers and used for accessing hardware.  The
standards encourage compilers to refrain from optimizations
concerning accesses to volatile objects that it might perform on
non-volatile objects.  The C standard leaves it implementation defined
as to what constitutes a volatile access.  The C++ standard omits to
specify this, except to say that C++ should behave in a similar manner
to C with respect to volatiles, where possible.  The minimum either
standard specifies is that at a sequence point all previous accesses to
volatile objects have stabilized and no subsequent accesses have
occurred.  Thus an implementation is free to reorder and combine
volatile accesses which occur between sequence points, but cannot do so
for accesses across a sequence point.  The use of volatiles does not
allow you to violate the restriction on updating objects multiple times
within a sequence point.

   <p>In most expressions, it is intuitively obvious what is a read and what is
a write.  For instance

<pre class="example">     volatile int *dst = <var>somevalue</var>;
     volatile int *src = <var>someothervalue</var>;
     *dst = *src;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will cause a read of the volatile object pointed to by <var>src</var> and stores the
value into the volatile object pointed to by <var>dst</var>.  There is no
guarantee that these reads and writes are atomic, especially for objects
larger than <code>int</code>.

   <p>Less obvious expressions are where something which looks like an access
is used in a void context.  An example would be,

<pre class="example">     volatile int *src = <var>somevalue</var>;
     *src;
</pre>
   <p>With C, such expressions are rvalues, and as rvalues cause a read of
the object, GCC interprets this as a read of the volatile being pointed
to.  The C++ standard specifies that such expressions do not undergo
lvalue to rvalue conversion, and that the type of the dereferenced
object may be incomplete.  The C++ standard does not specify explicitly
that it is this lvalue to rvalue conversion which is responsible for
causing an access.  However, there is reason to believe that it is,
because otherwise certain simple expressions become undefined.  However,
because it would surprise most programmers, G++ treats dereferencing a
pointer to volatile object of complete type in a void context as a read
of the object.  When the object has incomplete type, G++ issues a
warning.

<pre class="example">     struct S;
     struct T {int m;};
     volatile S *ptr1 = <var>somevalue</var>;
     volatile T *ptr2 = <var>somevalue</var>;
     *ptr1;
     *ptr2;
</pre>
   <p>In this example, a warning is issued for <code>*ptr1</code>, and <code>*ptr2</code>
causes a read of the object pointed to.  If you wish to force an error on
the first case, you must force a conversion to rvalue with, for instance
a static cast, <code>static_cast&lt;S&gt;(*ptr1)</code>.

   <p>When using a reference to volatile, G++ does not treat equivalent
expressions as accesses to volatiles, but instead issues a warning that
no volatile is accessed.  The rationale for this is that otherwise it
becomes difficult to determine where volatile access occur, and not
possible to ignore the return value from functions returning volatile
references.  Again, if you wish to force a read, cast the reference to
an rvalue.

<h3 class="section">6.3 Restricting Pointer Aliasing</h3>

<p><a name="index-restricted-pointers-1904"></a><a name="index-restricted-references-1905"></a><a name="index-restricted-this-pointer-1906"></a>
As with gcc, g++ understands the C99 feature of restricted pointers,
specified with the <code>__restrict__</code>, or <code>__restrict</code> type
qualifier.  Because you cannot compile C++ by specifying the <span class="option">-std=c99</span>
language flag, <code>restrict</code> is not a keyword in C++.

   <p>In addition to allowing restricted pointers, you can specify restricted
references, which indicate that the reference is not aliased in the local
context.

<pre class="example">     void fn (int *__restrict__ rptr, int &amp;__restrict__ rref)
     {
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In the body of <code>fn</code>, <var>rptr</var> points to an unaliased integer and
<var>rref</var> refers to a (different) unaliased integer.

   <p>You may also specify whether a member function's <var>this</var> pointer is
unaliased by using <code>__restrict__</code> as a member function qualifier.

<pre class="example">     void T::fn () __restrict__
     {
       /* <span class="roman">...</span> */
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Within the body of <code>T::fn</code>, <var>this</var> will have the effective
definition <code>T *__restrict__ const this</code>.  Notice that the
interpretation of a <code>__restrict__</code> member function qualifier is
different to that of <code>const</code> or <code>volatile</code> qualifier, in that it
is applied to the pointer rather than the object.  This is consistent with
other compilers which implement restricted pointers.

   <p>As with all outermost parameter qualifiers, <code>__restrict__</code> is
ignored in function definition matching.  This means you only need to
specify <code>__restrict__</code> in a function definition, rather than
in a function prototype as well.

<h3 class="section">6.4 Vague Linkage</h3>

<p><a name="index-vague-linkage-1907"></a>
There are several constructs in C++ which require space in the object
file but are not clearly tied to a single translation unit.  We say that
these constructs have &ldquo;vague linkage&rdquo;.  Typically such constructs are
emitted wherever they are needed, though sometimes we can be more
clever.

     <dl>
<dt>Inline Functions<dd>Inline functions are typically defined in a header file which can be
included in many different compilations.  Hopefully they can usually be
inlined, but sometimes an out-of-line copy is necessary, if the address
of the function is taken or if inlining fails.  In general, we emit an
out-of-line copy in all translation units where one is needed.  As an
exception, we only emit inline virtual functions with the vtable, since
it will always require a copy.

     <p>Local static variables and string constants used in an inline function
are also considered to have vague linkage, since they must be shared
between all inlined and out-of-line instances of the function.

     <br><dt>VTables<dd><a name="index-vtable-1908"></a>C++ virtual functions are implemented in most compilers using a lookup
table, known as a vtable.  The vtable contains pointers to the virtual
functions provided by a class, and each object of the class contains a
pointer to its vtable (or vtables, in some multiple-inheritance
situations).  If the class declares any non-inline, non-pure virtual
functions, the first one is chosen as the &ldquo;key method&rdquo; for the class,
and the vtable is only emitted in the translation unit where the key
method is defined.

     <p><em>Note:</em> If the chosen key method is later defined as inline, the
vtable will still be emitted in every translation unit which defines it. 
Make sure that any inline virtuals are declared inline in the class
body, even if they are not defined there.

     <br><dt>type_info objects<dd><a name="index-type_005finfo-1909"></a><a name="index-RTTI-1910"></a>C++ requires information about types to be written out in order to
implement <span class="samp">dynamic_cast</span>, <span class="samp">typeid</span> and exception handling. 
For polymorphic classes (classes with virtual functions), the type_info
object is written out along with the vtable so that <span class="samp">dynamic_cast</span>
can determine the dynamic type of a class object at runtime.  For all
other types, we write out the type_info object when it is used: when
applying <span class="samp">typeid</span> to an expression, throwing an object, or
referring to a type in a catch clause or exception specification.

     <br><dt>Template Instantiations<dd>Most everything in this section also applies to template instantiations,
but there are other options as well. 
See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Where's the Template?</a>.

   </dl>

   <p>When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
Linux/GNU or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, duplicate copies of
these constructs will be discarded at link time.  This is known as
COMDAT support.

   <p>On targets that don't support COMDAT, but do support weak symbols, GCC
will use them.  This way one copy will override all the others, but
the unused copies will still take up space in the executable.

   <p>For targets which do not support either COMDAT or weak symbols,
most entities with vague linkage will be emitted as local symbols to
avoid duplicate definition errors from the linker.  This will not happen
for local statics in inlines, however, as having multiple copies will
almost certainly break things.

   <p>See <a href="#C_002b_002b-Interface">Declarations and Definitions in One Header</a>, for
another way to control placement of these constructs.

<p><a name="index-interface-and-implementation-headers_002c-C_002b_002b-1911"></a><a name="index-C_002b_002b-interface-and-implementation-headers-1912"></a>C++ object definitions can be quite complex.  In principle, your source
code will need two kinds of things for each object that you use across
more than one source file.  First, you need an <dfn>interface</dfn>
specification, describing its structure with type declarations and
function prototypes.  Second, you need the <dfn>implementation</dfn> itself. 
It can be tedious to maintain a separate interface description in a
header file, in parallel to the actual implementation.  It is also
dangerous, since separate interface and implementation definitions may
not remain parallel.

   <p><a name="index-pragmas_002c-interface-and-implementation-1913"></a>With GNU C++, you can use a single header file for both purposes.

   <blockquote>
<em>Warning:</em> The mechanism to specify this is in transition.  For the
nonce, you must use one of two <code>#pragma</code> commands; in a future
release of GNU C++, an alternative mechanism will make these
<code>#pragma</code> commands unnecessary. 
</blockquote>

   <p>The header file contains the full definitions, but is marked with
<span class="samp">#pragma interface</span> in the source code.  This allows the compiler
to use the header file only as an interface specification when ordinary
source files incorporate it with <code>#include</code>.  In the single source
file where the full implementation belongs, you can use either a naming
convention or <span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span> to indicate this alternate
use of the header file.

     <dl>
<dt><code>#pragma interface</code><dt><code>#pragma interface "</code><var>subdir</var><code>/</code><var>objects</var><code>.h"</code><dd><a name="index-_0023pragma-interface-1914"></a>Use this directive in <em>header files</em> that define object classes, to save
space in most of the object files that use those classes.  Normally,
local copies of certain information (backup copies of inline member
functions, debugging information, and the internal tables that implement
virtual functions) must be kept in each object file that includes class
definitions.  You can use this pragma to avoid such duplication.  When a
header file containing <span class="samp">#pragma interface</span> is included in a
compilation, this auxiliary information will not be generated (unless
the main input source file itself uses <span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span>). 
Instead, the object files will contain references to be resolved at link
time.

     <p>The second form of this directive is useful for the case where you have
multiple headers with the same name in different directories.  If you
use this form, you must specify the same string to <span class="samp">#pragma
implementation</span>.

     <br><dt><code>#pragma implementation</code><dt><code>#pragma implementation "</code><var>objects</var><code>.h"</code><dd><a name="index-_0023pragma-implementation-1915"></a>Use this pragma in a <em>main input file</em>, when you want full output from
included header files to be generated (and made globally visible).  The
included header file, in turn, should use <span class="samp">#pragma interface</span>. 
Backup copies of inline member functions, debugging information, and the
internal tables used to implement virtual functions are all generated in
implementation files.

an include file with the same basename<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a> as your source
file.  For example, in <span class="file">allclass.cc</span>, giving just
<span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span>
by itself is equivalent to <span class="samp">#pragma implementation "allclass.h"</span>.

     <p>In versions of GNU C++ prior to 2.6.0 <span class="file">allclass.h</span> was treated as
an implementation file whenever you would include it from
<span class="file">allclass.cc</span> even if you never specified <span class="samp">#pragma
implementation</span>.  This was deemed to be more trouble than it was worth,
however, and disabled.

     <p>If you use an explicit <span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span>, it must appear in
your source file <em>before</em> you include the affected header files.

     <p>Use the string argument if you want a single implementation file to
include code from multiple header files.  (You must also use
<span class="samp">#include</span> to include the header file; <span class="samp">#pragma
implementation</span> only specifies how to use the file&mdash;it doesn't actually
include it.)

     <p>There is no way to split up the contents of a single header file into

effect on function inlining.

   <p>If you define a class in a header file marked with <span class="samp">#pragma

an explicit <code>extern</code> declaration&mdash;the compiler emits no code at
all to define an independent version of the function.  Its definition
is used only for inlining with its callers.

   <p><a name="index-fno_002dimplement_002dinlines-1922"></a>Conversely, when you include the same header file in a main source file
that declares it as <span class="samp">#pragma implementation</span>, the compiler emits
code for the function itself; this defines a version of the function
that can be found via pointers (or by callers compiled without
inlining).  If all calls to the function can be inlined, you can avoid
emitting the function by compiling with <span class="option">-fno-implement-inlines</span>. 
If any calls were not inlined, you will get linker errors.

<h3 class="section">6.6 Where's the Template?</h3>

<p><a name="index-template-instantiation-1923"></a>
C++ templates are the first language feature to require more
intelligence from the environment than one usually finds on a UNIX
system.  Somehow the compiler and linker have to make sure that each
template instance occurs exactly once in the executable if it is needed,
and not at all otherwise.  There are two basic approaches to this
problem, which I will refer to as the Borland model and the Cfront model.

     <dl>
<dt>Borland model<dd>Borland C++ solved the template instantiation problem by adding the code
equivalent of common blocks to their linker; the compiler emits template
instances in each translation unit that uses them, and the linker
collapses them together.  The advantage of this model is that the linker
only has to consider the object files themselves; there is no external
complexity to worry about.  This disadvantage is that compilation time
is increased because the template code is being compiled repeatedly. 
Code written for this model tends to include definitions of all
templates in the header file, since they must be seen to be
instantiated.

     <br><dt>Cfront model<dd>The AT&amp;T C++ translator, Cfront, solved the template instantiation
problem by creating the notion of a template repository, an
automatically maintained place where template instances are stored.  A
more modern version of the repository works as follows: As individual
object files are built, the compiler places any template definitions and
instantiations encountered in the repository.  At link time, the link
wrapper adds in the objects in the repository and compiles any needed
instances that were not previously emitted.  The advantages of this
model are more optimal compilation speed and the ability to use the
system linker; to implement the Borland model a compiler vendor also
needs to replace the linker.  The disadvantages are vastly increased
complexity, and thus potential for error; for some code this can be
just as transparent, but in practice it can been very difficult to build
multiple programs in one directory and one program in multiple
directories.  Code written for this model tends to separate definitions
of non-inline member templates into a separate file, which should be
compiled separately. 
</dl>

   <p>When used with GNU ld version 2.8 or later on an ELF system such as
Linux/GNU or Solaris 2, or on Microsoft Windows, g++ supports the
Borland model.  On other systems, g++ implements neither automatic
model.

   <p>A future version of g++ will support a hybrid model whereby the compiler
will emit any instantiations for which the template definition is
included in the compile, and store template definitions and
instantiation context information into the object file for the rest. 
The link wrapper will extract that information as necessary and invoke
the compiler to produce the remaining instantiations.  The linker will
then combine duplicate instantiations.

   <p>In the mean time, you have the following options for dealing with
template instantiations:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li><a name="index-frepo-1924"></a>Compile your template-using code with <span class="option">-frepo</span>.  The compiler will
generate files with the extension <span class="samp">.rpo</span> listing all of the
template instantiations used in the corresponding object files which
could be instantiated there; the link wrapper, <span class="samp">collect2</span>, will
then update the <span class="samp">.rpo</span> files to tell the compiler where to place
those instantiations and rebuild any affected object files.  The
link-time overhead is negligible after the first pass, as the compiler
will continue to place the instantiations in the same files.

     <p>This is your best option for application code written for the Borland
model, as it will just work.  Code written for the Cfront model will
need to be modified so that the template definitions are available at
one or more points of instantiation; usually this is as simple as adding
<code>#include &lt;tmethods.cc&gt;</code> to the end of each template header.

     <p>For library code, if you want the library to provide all of the template
instantiations it needs, just try to link all of its object files
together; the link will fail, but cause the instantiations to be
generated as a side effect.  Be warned, however, that this may cause
conflicts if multiple libraries try to provide the same instantiations. 
For greater control, use explicit instantiation as described in the next
option.

     <li><a name="index-fno_002dimplicit_002dtemplates-1925"></a>Compile your code with <span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span> to disable the
implicit generation of template instances, and explicitly instantiate
all the ones you use.  This approach requires more knowledge of exactly
which instances you need than do the others, but it's less
mysterious and allows greater control.  You can scatter the explicit
instantiations throughout your program, perhaps putting them in the
translation units where the instances are used or the translation units
that define the templates themselves; you can put all of the explicit
instantiations you need into one big file; or you can create small files
like

     <pre class="example">          #include "Foo.h"
          #include "Foo.cc"
          
          template class Foo&lt;int&gt;;
          template ostream&amp; operator &lt;&lt;
                          (ostream&amp;, const Foo&lt;int&gt;&amp;);
     </pre>
     <p>for each of the instances you need, and create a template instantiation
library from those.

     <p>If you are using Cfront-model code, you can probably get away with not
using <span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span> when compiling files that don't
<span class="samp">#include</span> the member template definitions.

     <p>If you use one big file to do the instantiations, you may want to
compile it without <span class="option">-fno-implicit-templates</span> so you get all of the
instances required by your explicit instantiations (but not by any
other files) without having to specify them as well.

     <p>g++ has extended the template instantiation syntax given in the ISO
standard to allow forward declaration of explicit instantiations
(with <code>extern</code>), instantiation of the compiler support data for a
template class (i.e. the vtable) without instantiating any of its
members (with <code>inline</code>), and instantiation of only the static data
members of a template class, without the support data or member
functions (with (<code>static</code>):

     <pre class="example">          extern template int max (int, int);
          inline template class Foo&lt;int&gt;;
          static template class Foo&lt;int&gt;;
     </pre>
     <li>Do nothing.  Pretend g++ does implement automatic instantiation
management.  Code written for the Borland model will work fine, but
each translation unit will contain instances of each of the templates it
uses.  In a large program, this can lead to an unacceptable amount of code
duplication.

     <p>See <a href="#C_002b_002b-Interface">Declarations and Definitions in One Header</a>, for
more discussion of these pragmas.

<h3 class="section">6.7 Extracting the function pointer from a bound pointer to member function</h3>

<p><a name="index-pmf-1926"></a><a name="index-pointer-to-member-function-1927"></a><a name="index-bound-pointer-to-member-function-1928"></a>
In C++, pointer to member functions (PMFs) are implemented using a wide
pointer of sorts to handle all the possible call mechanisms; the PMF
needs to store information about how to adjust the <span class="samp">this</span> pointer,
and if the function pointed to is virtual, where to find the vtable, and
where in the vtable to look for the member function.  If you are using
PMFs in an inner loop, you should really reconsider that decision.  If
that is not an option, you can extract the pointer to the function that
would be called for a given object/PMF pair and call it directly inside
the inner loop, to save a bit of time.

   <p>Note that you will still be paying the penalty for the call through a
function pointer; on most modern architectures, such a call defeats the
branch prediction features of the CPU.  This is also true of normal
virtual function calls.

   <p>The syntax for this extension is

<pre class="example">     extern A a;
     extern int (A::*fp)();
     typedef int (*fptr)(A *);
     
     fptr p = (fptr)(a.*fp);
</pre>
   <p>For PMF constants (i.e. expressions of the form <span class="samp">&amp;Klasse::Member</span>),
no object is needed to obtain the address of the function.  They can be
converted to function pointers directly:

<pre class="example">     fptr p1 = (fptr)(&amp;A::foo);
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-Wno_002dpmf_002dconversions-1929"></a>You must specify <span class="option">-Wno-pmf-conversions</span> to use this extension.

<h3 class="section">6.8 C++-Specific Variable, Function, and Type Attributes</h3>

<p>Some attributes only make sense for C++ programs.

     <dl>
<dt><code>init_priority (</code><var>priority</var><code>)</code><dd><a name="index-init_005fpriority-attribute-1930"></a>

     <p>In Standard C++, objects defined at namespace scope are guaranteed to be
initialized in an order in strict accordance with that of their definitions
<em>in a given translation unit</em>.  No guarantee is made for initializations
across translation units.  However, GNU C++ allows users to control the
order of initialization of objects defined at namespace scope with the
<code>init_priority</code> attribute by specifying a relative <var>priority</var>,
a constant integral expression currently bounded between 101 and 65535
inclusive.  Lower numbers indicate a higher priority.

     <p>In the following example, <code>A</code> would normally be created before
<code>B</code>, but the <code>init_priority</code> attribute has reversed that order:

     <pre class="smallexample">          Some_Class  A  __attribute__ ((init_priority (2000)));
          Some_Class  B  __attribute__ ((init_priority (543)));
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Note that the particular values of <var>priority</var> do not matter; only their
relative ordering.

     <br><dt><code>java_interface</code><dd><a name="index-java_005finterface-attribute-1931"></a>
This type attribute informs C++ that the class is a Java interface.  It may
only be applied to classes declared within an <code>extern "Java"</code> block. 
Calls to methods declared in this interface will be dispatched using GCJ's
interface table mechanism, instead of regular virtual table dispatch.

<h3 class="section">6.9 Java Exceptions</h3>

<p>The Java language uses a slightly different exception handling model
from C++.  Normally, GNU C++ will automatically detect when you are
writing C++ code that uses Java exceptions, and handle them
appropriately.  However, if C++ code only needs to execute destructors
when Java exceptions are thrown through it, GCC will guess incorrectly. 
Sample problematic code is:

<pre class="smallexample">       struct S { ~S(); };
       extern void bar();    // is written in Java, and may throw exceptions
       void foo()
       {
         S s;
         bar();
       }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The usual effect of an incorrect guess is a link failure, complaining of
a missing routine called <span class="samp">__gxx_personality_v0</span>.

   <p>You can inform the compiler that Java exceptions are to be used in a
translation unit, irrespective of what it might think, by writing
<span class="samp">#pragma&nbsp;GCC&nbsp;java_exceptions<!-- /@w --></span> at the head of the file.  This
<span class="samp">#pragma</span> must appear before any functions that throw or catch
exceptions, or run destructors when exceptions are thrown through them.

   <p>You cannot mix Java and C++ exceptions in the same translation unit.  It
is believed to be safe to throw a C++ exception from one file through
another file compiled for the Java exception model, or vice versa, but
there may be bugs in this area.

<h3 class="section">6.10 Deprecated Features</h3>

<p>In the past, the GNU C++ compiler was extended to experiment with new
features, at a time when the C++ language was still evolving.  Now that
the C++ standard is complete, some of those features are superseded by
superior alternatives.  Using the old features might cause a warning in
some cases that the feature will be dropped in the future.  In other
cases, the feature might be gone already.

   <p>While the list below is not exhaustive, it documents some of the options
that are now deprecated:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-fexternal-templates</code><dt><code>-falt-external-templates</code><dd>These are two of the many ways for g++ to implement template
instantiation.  See <a href="#Template-Instantiation">Template Instantiation</a>.  The C++ standard clearly
defines how template definitions have to be organized across
implementation units.  g++ has an implicit instantiation mechanism that
should work just fine for standard-conforming code.

     <br><dt><code>-fstrict-prototype</code><dt><code>-fno-strict-prototype</code><dd>Previously it was possible to use an empty prototype parameter list to
indicate an unspecified number of parameters (like C), rather than no
parameters, as C++ demands.  This feature has been removed, except where
it is required for backwards compatibility See <a href="#Backwards-Compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</a>. 
</dl>

   <p>The named return value extension has been deprecated, and is now
removed from g++.

   <p>The use of initializer lists with new expressions has been deprecated,
and is now removed from g++.

   <p>Floating and complex non-type template parameters have been deprecated,
and are now removed from g++.

   <p>The implicit typename extension has been deprecated and will be removed
from g++ at some point.  In some cases g++ determines that a dependent
type such as <code>TPL&lt;T&gt;::X</code> is a type without needing a
<code>typename</code> keyword, contrary to the standard.

Now that there is a definitive ISO standard C++, G++ has a specification
to adhere to.  The C++ language evolved over time, and features that
used to be acceptable in previous drafts of the standard, such as the ARM
[Annotated C++ Reference Manual], are no longer accepted.  In order to allow
compilation of C++ written to such drafts, G++ contains some backwards
compatibilities.  <em>All such backwards compatibility features are
liable to disappear in future versions of G++.</em> They should be considered
deprecated See <a href="#Deprecated-Features">Deprecated Features</a>.

     <dl>
<dt><code>For scope</code><dd>If a variable is declared at for scope, it used to remain in scope until
the end of the scope which contained the for statement (rather than just
within the for scope).  G++ retains this, but issues a warning, if such a
variable is accessed outside the for scope.

     <br><dt><code>Implicit C language</code><dd>Old C system header files did not contain an <code>extern "C" {...}</code>
scope to set the language.  On such systems, all header files are
implicitly scoped inside a C language scope.  Also, an empty prototype
<code>()</code> will be treated as an unspecified number of arguments, rather
than no arguments, as C++ demands.

<h3 class="section">7.1 <code>+load</code>: Executing code before main</h3>

<p>The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a way that allows you to execute
code before the execution of the program enters the <code>main</code>
function.  The code is executed on a per-class and a per-category basis,
through a special class method <code>+load</code>.

   <p>This facility is very useful if you want to initialize global variables
which can be accessed by the program directly, without sending a message
to the class first.  The usual way to initialize global variables, in the
<code>+initialize</code> method, might not be useful because
<code>+initialize</code> is only called when the first message is sent to a
class object, which in some cases could be too late.

   <p>Suppose for example you have a <code>FileStream</code> class that declares
<code>Stdin</code>, <code>Stdout</code> and <code>Stderr</code> as global variables, like
below:

<pre class="example">     
     FileStream *Stdin = nil;
     FileStream *Stdout = nil;
     FileStream *Stderr = nil;
     
     @implementation FileStream
     
     + (void)initialize
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }
     
     /* Other methods here */
     @end
     
</pre>
   <p>In this example, the initialization of <code>Stdin</code>, <code>Stdout</code> and
<code>Stderr</code> in <code>+initialize</code> occurs too late.  The programmer can
send a message to one of these objects before the variables are actually
initialized, thus sending messages to the <code>nil</code> object.  The
<code>+initialize</code> method which actually initializes the global
variables is not invoked until the first message is sent to the class
object.  The solution would require these variables to be initialized
just before entering <code>main</code>.

   <p>The correct solution of the above problem is to use the <code>+load</code>
method instead of <code>+initialize</code>:

<pre class="example">     
     @implementation FileStream
     
     + (void)load
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }
     
     /* Other methods here */
     @end
     
</pre>
   <p>The <code>+load</code> is a method that is not overridden by categories.  If a
class and a category of it both implement <code>+load</code>, both methods are
invoked.  This allows some additional initializations to be performed in
a category.

   <p>This mechanism is not intended to be a replacement for <code>+initialize</code>. 
You should be aware of its limitations when you decide to use it
instead of <code>+initialize</code>.

<br>
</div>

<h4 class="subsection">7.1.1 What you can and what you cannot do in <code>+load</code></h4>

<p>The <code>+load</code> implementation in the GNU runtime guarantees you the following
things:

     <ul>
<li>you can write whatever C code you like;

     <li>you can send messages to Objective-C constant strings (<code>@"this is a
constant string"</code>);

     <li>you can allocate and send messages to objects whose class is implemented
in the same file;

     <li>the <code>+load</code> implementation of all super classes of a class are executed before the <code>+load</code> of that class is executed;

     <li>the <code>+load</code> implementation of a class is executed before the
<code>+load</code> implementation of any category.

   </ul>

   <p>In particular, the following things, even if they can work in a
particular case, are not guaranteed:

     <ul>
<li>allocation of or sending messages to arbitrary objects;

     <li>allocation of or sending messages to objects whose classes have a
category implemented in the same file;

   </ul>

   <p>You should make no assumptions about receiving <code>+load</code> in sibling
classes when you write <code>+load</code> of a class.  The order in which
sibling classes receive <code>+load</code> is not guaranteed.

   <p>The order in which <code>+load</code> and <code>+initialize</code> are called could
be problematic if this matters.  If you don't allocate objects inside
<code>+load</code>, it is guaranteed that <code>+load</code> is called before
<code>+initialize</code>.  If you create an object inside <code>+load</code> the
<code>+initialize</code> method of object's class is invoked even if
<code>+load</code> was not invoked.  Note if you explicitly call <code>+load</code>
on a class, <code>+initialize</code> will be called first.  To avoid possible
problems try to implement only one of these methods.

   <p>The <code>+load</code> method is also invoked when a bundle is dynamically
loaded into your running program.  This happens automatically without any
intervening operation from you.  When you write bundles and you need to
write <code>+load</code> you can safely create and send messages to objects whose
classes already exist in the running program.  The same restrictions as
above apply to classes defined in bundle.

<h3 class="section">7.2 Type encoding</h3>

<p>The Objective-C compiler generates type encodings for all the
types.  These type encodings are used at runtime to find out information
about selectors and methods and about objects and classes.

   <p>The types are encoded in the following way:

<!-- @sp 1 -->
<p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%"><code>char</code>

<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">bit-fields
</td><td valign="top" width="75%"><code>b</code> followed by the starting position of the bit-field, the type of the bit-field and the size of the bit-field (the bit-fields encoding was changed from the NeXT's compiler encoding, see below)
   <br></td></tr></table>

<!-- @sp 1 -->
<p>The encoding of bit-fields has changed to allow bit-fields to be properly
handled by the runtime functions that compute sizes and alignments of
types that contain bit-fields.  The previous encoding contained only the
size of the bit-field.  Using only this information it is not possible to
reliably compute the size occupied by the bit-field.  This is very
important in the presence of the Boehm's garbage collector because the
objects are allocated using the typed memory facility available in this
collector.  The typed memory allocation requires information about where
the pointers are located inside the object.

   <p>The position in the bit-field is the position, counting in bits, of the
bit closest to the beginning of the structure.

   <p>The non-atomic types are encoded as follows:

<!-- @sp 1 -->
<p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">pointers
</td><td valign="top" width="80%"><span class="samp">^</span> followed by the pointed type. 
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">arrays
</td><td valign="top" width="80%"><span class="samp">[</span> followed by the number of elements in the array followed by the type of the elements followed by <span class="samp">]</span>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">structures
</td><td valign="top" width="80%"><span class="samp">{</span> followed by the name of the structure (or <span class="samp">?</span> if the structure is unnamed), the <span class="samp">=</span> sign, the type of the members and by <span class="samp">}</span>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">unions
</td><td valign="top" width="80%"><span class="samp">(</span> followed by the name of the structure (or <span class="samp">?</span> if the union is unnamed), the <span class="samp">=</span> sign, the type of the members followed by <span class="samp">)</span>
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>Here are some types and their encodings, as they are generated by the
compiler on an i386 machine:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">Objective-C type
</td><td valign="top" width="75%">Compiler encoding
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">

   <p></td><td valign="top" width="75%"><code>[10i]</code>
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">
<pre class="example">     struct {
       int i;
       float f[3];
       int a:3;
       int b:2;
       char c;
     }
</pre>
   <p></td><td valign="top" width="75%"><code>{?=i[3f]b128i3b131i2c}</code>
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

In addition to the types the compiler also encodes the type
specifiers.  The table below describes the encoding of the current
Objective-C type specifiers:

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="25%">Specifier

   <br></td></tr></table>

   <pre class="sp">

The type specifiers are encoded just before the type.  Unlike types
however, the type specifiers are only encoded when they appear in method
argument types.

<h3 class="section">7.3 Garbage Collection</h3>

<p>Support for a new memory management policy has been added by using a
powerful conservative garbage collector, known as the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector.  It is available from
<a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/">http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/</a><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>To enable the support for it you have to configure the compiler using an
additional argument, <span class="option">--enable-objc-gc</span><!-- /@w -->.  You need to have
garbage collector installed before building the compiler.  This will
build an additional runtime library which has several enhancements to
support the garbage collector.  The new library has a new name,
<span class="file">libobjc_gc.a</span> to not conflict with the non-garbage-collected
library.

   <p>When the garbage collector is used, the objects are allocated using the
so-called typed memory allocation mechanism available in the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector.  This mode requires precise information on
where pointers are located inside objects.  This information is computed
once per class, immediately after the class has been initialized.

   <p>There is a new runtime function <code>class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()</code>
which can be used to declare a so-called <dfn>weak pointer</dfn>
reference.  Such a pointer is basically hidden for the garbage collector;
this can be useful in certain situations, especially when you want to
keep track of the allocated objects, yet allow them to be
collected.  This kind of pointers can only be members of objects, you
cannot declare a global pointer as a weak reference.  Every type which is
a pointer type can be declared a weak pointer, including <code>id</code>,
<code>Class</code> and <code>SEL</code>.

   <p>Here is an example of how to use this feature.  Suppose you want to
implement a class whose instances hold a weak pointer reference; the
following class does this:

<pre class="example">     
     @interface WeakPointer : Object
     {
         const void* weakPointer;
     }
     
     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p;
     - (const void*)weakPointer;
     @end
     
     
     @implementation WeakPointer
     
     + (void)initialize
     {
       class_ivar_set_gcinvisible (self, "weakPointer", YES);
     }
     
     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p
     {
       weakPointer = p;
       return self;
     }
     
     - (const void*)weakPointer
     {
       return weakPointer;
     }
     
     @end
     
</pre>
   <p>Weak pointers are supported through a new type character specifier
represented by the <span class="samp">!</span> character.  The
<code>class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()</code> function adds or removes this
specifier to the string type description of the instance variable named
as argument.

<h3 class="section">7.4 Constant string objects</h3>

<p>GNU Objective-C provides constant string objects that are generated
directly by the compiler.  You declare a constant string object by
prefixing a C constant string with the character <span class="samp">@</span>:

<pre class="example">       id myString = @"this is a constant string object";
</pre>
   <p>The constant string objects are by default instances of the
<code>NXConstantString</code> class which is provided by the GNU Objective-C
runtime.  To get the definition of this class you must include the
<span class="file">objc/NXConstStr.h</span> header file.

   <p>User defined libraries may want to implement their own constant string
class.  To be able to support them, the GNU Objective-C compiler provides
a new command line options <span class="option">-fconstant-string-class=</span><var>class-name</var>. 
The provided class should adhere to a strict structure, the same
as <code>NXConstantString</code>'s structure:

<pre class="example">     
     @interface MyConstantStringClass
     {
       Class isa;
       char *c_string;
       unsigned int len;
     }
     @end
     
</pre>
   <p><code>NXConstantString</code> inherits from <code>Object</code>; user class
libraries may choose to inherit the customized constant string class
from a different class than <code>Object</code>.  There is no requirement in
the methods the constant string class has to implement, but the final
ivar layout of the class must be the compatible with the given
structure.

   <p>When the compiler creates the statically allocated constant string
object, the <code>c_string</code> field will be filled by the compiler with
the string; the <code>length</code> field will be filled by the compiler with
the string length; the <code>isa</code> pointer will be filled with
<code>NULL</code> by the compiler, and it will later be fixed up automatically
at runtime by the GNU Objective-C runtime library to point to the class
which was set by the <span class="option">-fconstant-string-class</span> option when the
object file is loaded (if you wonder how it works behind the scenes, the
name of the class to use, and the list of static objects to fixup, are
stored by the compiler in the object file in a place where the GNU
runtime library will find them at runtime).

   <p>As a result, when a file is compiled with the
<span class="option">-fconstant-string-class</span> option, all the constant string objects
will be instances of the class specified as argument to this option.  It
is possible to have multiple compilation units referring to different
constant string classes, neither the compiler nor the linker impose any
restrictions in doing this.

<h3 class="section">7.5 compatibility_alias</h3>

<p>This is a feature of the Objective-C compiler rather than of the
runtime, anyway since it is documented nowhere and its existence was
forgotten, we are documenting it here.

   <p>The keyword <code>@compatibility_alias</code> allows you to define a class name
as equivalent to another class name.  For example:

<pre class="example">     @compatibility_alias WOApplication GSWApplication;
</pre>
   <p>tells the compiler that each time it encounters <code>WOApplication</code> as
a class name, it should replace it with <code>GSWApplication</code> (that is,
<code>WOApplication</code> is just an alias for <code>GSWApplication</code>).

   <p>There are some constraints on how this can be used&mdash;

     <ul>
<li><code>WOApplication</code> (the alias) must not be an existing class;

     <li><code>GSWApplication</code> (the real class) must be an existing class.

   </ul>

<h2 class="chapter">8 Binary Compatibility</h2>

<p><a name="index-binary-compatibility-1934"></a><a name="index-ABI-1935"></a><a name="index-application-binary-interface-1936"></a>
Binary compatibility encompasses several related concepts:

     <dl>
<dt><dfn>application binary interface (ABI)</dfn><dd>The set of runtime conventions followed by all of the tools that deal
with binary representations of a program, including compilers, assemblers,
linkers, and language runtime support. 
Some ABIs are formal with a written specification, possibly designed
by multiple interested parties.  Others are simply the way things are
actually done by a particular set of tools.

     <br><dt><dfn>ABI conformance</dfn><dd>A compiler conforms to an ABI if it generates code that follows all of
the specifications enumerated by that ABI. 
A library conforms to an ABI if it is implemented according to that ABI. 
An application conforms to an ABI if it is built using tools that conform
to that ABI and does not contain source code that specifically changes
behavior specified by the ABI.

     <br><dt><dfn>calling conventions</dfn><dd>Calling conventions are a subset of an ABI that specify of how arguments
are passed and function results are returned.

     <br><dt><dfn>interoperability</dfn><dd>Different sets of tools are interoperable if they generate files that
can be used in the same program.  The set of tools includes compilers,
assemblers, linkers, libraries, header files, startup files, and debuggers. 
Binaries produced by different sets of tools are not interoperable unless
they implement the same ABI.  This applies to different versions of the
same tools as well as tools from different vendors.

     <br><dt><dfn>intercallability</dfn><dd>Whether a function in a binary built by one set of tools can call a
function in a binary built by a different set of tools is a subset
of interoperability.

     <br><dt><dfn>implementation-defined features</dfn><dd>Language standards include lists of implementation-defined features whose
behavior can vary from one implementation to another.  Some of these
features are normally covered by a platform's ABI and others are not. 
The features that are not covered by an ABI generally affect how a
program behaves, but not intercallability.

     <br><dt><dfn>compatibility</dfn><dd>Conformance to the same ABI and the same behavior of implementation-defined
features are both relevant for compatibility. 
</dl>

   <p>The application binary interface implemented by a C or C++ compiler
affects code generation and runtime support for:

     <ul>
<li>size and alignment of data types
<li>layout of structured types
<li>calling conventions
<li>register usage conventions
<li>interfaces for runtime arithmetic support
<li>object file formats
</ul>

   <p>In addition, the application binary interface implemented by a C++ compiler
affects code generation and runtime support for:
     <ul>
<li>name mangling
<li>exception handling
<li>invoking constructors and destructors
<li>layout, alignment, and padding of classes
<li>layout and alignment of virtual tables
</ul>

   <p>Some GCC compilation options cause the compiler to generate code that
does not conform to the platform's default ABI.  Other options cause
different program behavior for implementation-defined features that are
not covered by an ABI.  These options are provided for consistency with
other compilers that do not follow the platform's default ABI or the
usual behavior of implementation-defined features for the platform. 
Be very careful about using such options.

   <p>Most platforms have a well-defined ABI that covers C code, but ABIs
that cover C++ functionality are not yet common.

   <p>Starting with GCC 3.2, GCC binary conventions for C++ are based on a
written, vendor-neutral C++ ABI that was designed to be specific to
64-bit Itanium but also includes generic specifications that apply to
any platform. 
This C++ ABI is also implemented by other compiler vendors on some
platforms, notably GNU/Linux and BSD systems. 
We have tried hard to provide a stable ABI that will be compatible with
future GCC releases, but it is possible that we will encounter problems
that make this difficult.  Such problems could include different
interpretations of the C++ ABI by different vendors, bugs in the ABI, or
bugs in the implementation of the ABI in different compilers. 
GCC's <code>-Wabi</code> switch warns when G++ generates code that is
probably not compatible with the C++ ABI.

   <p>The C++ library used with a C++ compiler includes the Standard C++
Library, with functionality defined in the C++ Standard, plus language
runtime support.  The runtime support is included in a C++ ABI, but there
is no formal ABI for the Standard C++ Library.  Two implementations
of that library are interoperable if one follows the de-facto ABI of the
other and if they are both built with the same compiler, or with compilers
that conform to the same ABI for C++ compiler and runtime support.

   <p>When G++ and another C++ compiler conform to the same C++ ABI, but the
implementations of the Standard C++ Library that they normally use do not
follow the same ABI for the Standard C++ Library, object files built with
those compilers can be used in the same program only if they use the same
C++ library.  This requires specifying the location of the C++ library
header files when invoking the compiler whose usual library is not being
used.  The location of GCC's C++ header files depends on how the GCC
build was configured, but can be seen by using the G++ <span class="option">-v</span> option. 
With default configuration options for G++ 3.3 the compile line for a
different C++ compiler needs to include

<pre class="example">         -I<var>gcc_install_directory</var>/include/c++/3.3
</pre>
   <p>Similarly, compiling code with G++ that must use a C++ library other
than the GNU C++ library requires specifying the location of the header
files for that other library.

   <p>The most straightforward way to link a program to use a particular
C++ library is to use a C++ driver that specifies that C++ library by
default.  The <span class="command">g++</span> driver, for example, tells the linker where
to find GCC's C++ library (<span class="file">libstdc++</span>) plus the other libraries
and startup files it needs, in the proper order.

   <p>If a program must use a different C++ library and it's not possible
to do the final link using a C++ driver that uses that library by default,
it is necessary to tell <span class="command">g++</span> the location and name of that
library.  It might also be necessary to specify different startup files
and other runtime support libraries, and to suppress the use of GCC's
support libraries with one or more of the options <span class="option">-nostdlib</span>,
<span class="option">-nostartfiles</span>, and <span class="option">-nodefaultlibs</span>.

<h3 class="section">9.1 Introduction to <span class="command">gcov</span></h3>

<!-- man begin DESCRIPTION -->
<p><span class="command">gcov</span> is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with GCC
to analyze your programs to help create more efficient, faster running
code and to discover untested parts of your program.  You can use
<span class="command">gcov</span> as a profiling tool to help discover where your
optimization efforts will best affect your code.  You can also use
<span class="command">gcov</span> along with the other profiling tool, <span class="command">gprof</span>, to
assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing
time.

   <p>Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance.  Using a
profiler such as <span class="command">gcov</span> or <span class="command">gprof</span>, you can find out some
basic performance statistics, such as:

     <ul>
<li>how often each line of code executes

     <li>what lines of code are actually executed

     <li>how much computing time each section of code uses
</ul>

   <p>Once you know these things about how your code works when compiled, you
can look at each module to see which modules should be optimized. 
<span class="command">gcov</span> helps you determine where to work on optimization.

   <p>Software developers also use coverage testing in concert with
testsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a release. 
Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a coverage
program tests to see how much of the program is exercised by the
testsuite.  Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases need
to be added to the testsuites to create both better testing and a better
final product.

   <p>You should compile your code without optimization if you plan to use
<span class="command">gcov</span> because the optimization, by combining some lines of code
into one function, may not give you as much information as you need to
look for `hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer
time.  Likewise, because <span class="command">gcov</span> accumulates statistics by line (at
the lowest resolution), it works best with a programming style that
places only one statement on each line.  If you use complicated macros
that expand to loops or to other control structures, the statistics are
less helpful&mdash;they only report on the line where the macro call
appears.  If your complex macros behave like functions, you can replace
them with inline functions to solve this problem.

   <p><span class="command">gcov</span> creates a logfile called <var>sourcefile</var><span class="file">.gcov</span> which
indicates how many times each line of a source file <var>sourcefile</var><span class="file">.c</span>
has executed.  You can use these logfiles along with <span class="command">gprof</span> to aid
in fine-tuning the performance of your programs.  <span class="command">gprof</span> gives
timing information you can use along with the information you get from
<span class="command">gcov</span>.

   <p><span class="command">gcov</span> works only on code compiled with GCC.  It is not
compatible with any other profiling or test coverage mechanism.

<h3 class="section">9.2 Invoking gcov</h3>

<pre class="smallexample">     gcov <span class="roman">[</span><var>options</var><span class="roman">]</span> <var>sourcefile</var>
</pre>
   <p><span class="command">gcov</span> accepts the following options:

<!-- man begin OPTIONS -->
<dl>
<dt><code>-h</code><dt><code>--help</code><dd>Display help about using <span class="command">gcov</span> (on the standard output), and
exit without doing any further processing.

     <br><dt><code>-v</code><dt><code>--version</code><dd>Display the <span class="command">gcov</span> version number (on the standard output),
and exit without doing any further processing.

     <br><dt><code>-b</code><dt><code>--branch-probabilities</code><dd>Write branch frequencies to the output file, and write branch summary
info to the standard output.  This option allows you to see how often
each branch in your program was taken.

     <br><dt><code>-c</code><dt><code>--branch-counts</code><dd>Write branch frequencies as the number of branches taken, rather than
the percentage of branches taken.

     <br><dt><code>-n</code><dt><code>--no-output</code><dd>Do not create the <span class="command">gcov</span> output file.

     <br><dt><code>-l</code><dt><code>--long-file-names</code><dd>Create long file names for included source files.  For example, if the
header file <span class="file">x.h</span> contains code, and was included in the file
<span class="file">a.c</span>, then running <span class="command">gcov</span> on the file <span class="file">a.c</span> will produce
an output file called <span class="file">a.c##x.h.gcov</span> instead of <span class="file">x.h.gcov</span>. 
This can be useful if <span class="file">x.h</span> is included in multiple source files.

     <br><dt><code>-p</code><dt><code>--preserve-paths</code><dd>Preserve complete path information in the names of generated
<span class="file">.gcov</span> files. Without this option, just the filename component is
used. With this option, all directories are used, with '/' characters
translated to '#' characters, '.' directory components removed and '..' 
components renamed to '^'. This is useful if sourcefiles are in several
different directories. It also affects the <span class="samp">-l</span> option.

     <br><dt><code>-f</code><dt><code>--function-summaries</code><dd>Output summaries for each function in addition to the file level summary.

     <br><dt><code>-o </code><var>directory|file</var><dt><code>--object-directory </code><var>directory</var><dt><code>--object-file </code><var>file</var><dd>Specify either the directory containing the gcov data files, or the
object path name. The <span class="file">.bb</span>, <span class="file">.bbg</span>, and
<span class="file">.da</span> data files are searched for using this option. If a directory
is specified, the data files are in that directory and named after the
source file name, without its extension. If a file is specified here,
the data files are named after that file, without its extension. If this
option is not supplied, it defaults to the current directory.

   </dl>

   <p><span class="command">gcov</span> should be run with the current directory the same as that
when you invoked the compiler. Otherwise it will not be able to locate
the source files. <span class="command">gcov</span> produces files called
<var>mangledname</var><span class="file">.gcov</span> in the current directory. These contain
the coverage information of the source file they correspond to. 
One <span class="file">.gcov</span> file is produced for each source file containing code,
which was compiled to produce the data files. The <span class="file">.gcov</span> files
contain the ':' separated fields along with program source code. The
format is

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>execution_count</var>:<var>line_number</var>:<var>source line text</var>
</pre>
   <p>Additional block information may succeed each line, when requested by
command line option. The <var>execution_count</var> is <span class="samp">-</span> for lines
containing no code and <span class="samp">#####</span> for lines which were never
executed. Some lines of information at the start have <var>line_number</var>
of zero.

   <p>When printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when the values
are <em>exactly</em> 0% and 100% respectively. Other values which would
conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead printed as the
nearest non-boundary value.

   <p>When using <span class="command">gcov</span>, you must first compile your program with two
special GCC options: <span class="samp">-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</span>. 
This tells the compiler to generate additional information needed by
gcov (basically a flow graph of the program) and also includes
additional code in the object files for generating the extra profiling
information needed by gcov.  These additional files are placed in the
directory where the object file is located.

   <p>Running the program will cause profile output to be generated.  For each
source file compiled with <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span>, an accompanying <span class="file">.da</span>
file will be placed in the object file directory.

   <p>Running <span class="command">gcov</span> with your program's source file names as arguments
will now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of execution
for each line.  For example, if your program is called <span class="file">tmp.c</span>, this
is what you see when you use the basic <span class="command">gcov</span> facility:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage tmp.c
     $ a.out
     $ gcov tmp.c
     90.00% of 10 source lines executed in file tmp.c
     Creating tmp.c.gcov.
</pre>
   <p>The file <span class="file">tmp.c.gcov</span> contains output from <span class="command">gcov</span>. 
Here is a sample:

<pre class="smallexample">             -:    0:Source:tmp.c
             -:    0:Object:tmp.bb
             -:    1:#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
             -:    2:
             -:    3:int main (void)
             1:    4:{
             1:    5:  int i, total;
             -:    6:
             1:    7:  total = 0;
             -:    8:
            11:    9:  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
            10:   10:    total += i;
             -:   11:
             1:   12:  if (total != 45)
         #####:   13:    printf ("Failure\n");
             -:   14:  else
             1:   15:    printf ("Success\n");
             1:   16:  return 0;
             1:   17:}
</pre>
   <p>When you use the <span class="option">-b</span> option, your output looks like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ gcov -b tmp.c
     90.00% of 10 source lines executed in file tmp.c
     80.00% of 5 branches executed in file tmp.c
     80.00% of 5 branches taken at least once in file tmp.c
     50.00% of 2 calls executed in file tmp.c
     Creating tmp.c.gcov.
</pre>
   <p>Here is a sample of a resulting <span class="file">tmp.c.gcov</span> file:

<pre class="smallexample">             -:    0:Source:tmp.c
             -:    0:Object:tmp.bb
             -:    1:#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
             -:    2:
             -:    3:int main (void)
             1:    4:{
             1:    5:  int i, total;
             -:    6:
             1:    7:  total = 0;
             -:    8:
            11:    9:  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
     branch  0: taken 90%
     branch  1: taken 100%
     branch  2: taken 100%
            10:   10:    total += i;
             -:   11:
             1:   12:  if (total != 45)
     branch  0: taken 100%
         #####:   13:    printf ("Failure\n");
     call    0: never executed
     branch  1: never executed
             -:   14:  else
             1:   15:    printf ("Success\n");
     call    0: returns 100%
             1:   16:  return 0;
             1:   17:}
</pre>
   <p>For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the basic
block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block.  There can
be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source line if there
are multiple basic blocks that end on that line.  In this case, the
branches and calls are each given a number.  There is no simple way to map
these branches and calls back to source constructs.  In general, though,
the lowest numbered branch or call will correspond to the leftmost construct
on the source line.

   <p>For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the
number of times the branch was executed will be printed.  Otherwise, the
message &ldquo;never executed&rdquo; is printed.

   <p>For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number
of times the call was executed will be printed.  This will usually be
100%, but may be less for functions call <code>exit</code> or <code>longjmp</code>,
and thus may not return every time they are called.

   <p>The execution counts are cumulative.  If the example program were
executed again without removing the <span class="file">.da</span> file, the count for the
number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to
the results of the previous run(s).  This is potentially useful in
several ways.  For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a
number of program runs as part of a test verification suite, or to
provide more accurate long-term information over a large number of
program runs.

   <p>The data in the <span class="file">.da</span> files is saved immediately before the program
exits.  For each source file compiled with <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span>, the
profiling code first attempts to read in an existing <span class="file">.da</span> file; if
the file doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block
counts) it will ignore the contents of the file.  It then adds in the
new execution counts and finally writes the data to the file.

<h3 class="section">9.3 Using <span class="command">gcov</span> with GCC Optimization</h3>

<p>If you plan to use <span class="command">gcov</span> to help optimize your code, you must
first compile your program with two special GCC options:
<span class="samp">-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage</span>.  Aside from that, you can use any
other GCC options; but if you want to prove that every single line
in your program was executed, you should not compile with optimization
at the same time.  On some machines the optimizer can eliminate some
simple code lines by combining them with other lines.  For example, code
like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     if (a != b)
       c = 1;
     else
       c = 0;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">can be compiled into one instruction on some machines.  In this case,
there is no way for <span class="command">gcov</span> to calculate separate execution counts
for each line because there isn't separate code for each line.  Hence
the <span class="command">gcov</span> output looks like this if you compiled the program with
optimization:

<pre class="smallexample">           100:   12:if (a != b)
           100:   13:  c = 1;
           100:   14:else
           100:   15:  c = 0;
</pre>
   <p>The output shows that this block of code, combined by optimization,
executed 100 times.  In one sense this result is correct, because there
was only one instruction representing all four of these lines.  However,
the output does not indicate how many times the result was 0 and how
many times the result was 1.

<h3 class="section">9.4 Brief description of <span class="command">gcov</span> data files</h3>

<p><span class="command">gcov</span> uses three files for doing profiling.  The names of these
files are derived from the original <em>source</em> file by substituting
the file suffix with either <span class="file">.bb</span>, <span class="file">.bbg</span>, or <span class="file">.da</span>.  All
of these files are placed in the same directory as the source file, and
contain data stored in a platform-independent method.

   <p>The <span class="file">.bb</span> and <span class="file">.bbg</span> files are generated when the source file
is compiled with the GCC <span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span> option.  The
<span class="file">.bb</span> file contains a list of source files (including headers),
functions within those files, and line numbers corresponding to each
basic block in the source file.

   <p>The <span class="file">.bb</span> file format consists of several lists of 4-byte integers
which correspond to the line numbers of each basic block in the file. 
Each list is terminated by a line number of 0.  A line number of
&minus;1 is used to designate that the source file name (padded to a
4-byte boundary and followed by another &minus;1) follows.  In
addition, a line number of &minus;2 is used to designate that the name
of a function (also padded to a 4-byte boundary and followed by a
&minus;2) follows.

   <p>The <span class="file">.bbg</span> file is used to reconstruct the program flow graph for
the source file.  It contains a list of the program flow arcs (possible
branches taken from one basic block to another) for each function which,
in combination with the <span class="file">.bb</span> file, enables gcov to reconstruct the
program flow.

   <p>In the <span class="file">.bbg</span> file, the format is:
<pre class="smallexample">             name of function #0
             checksum of function #0
             number of basic blocks for function #0 (4-byte number)
             total number of arcs for function #0 (4-byte number)
             count of arcs in basic block #0 (4-byte number)
             destination basic block of arc #0 (4-byte number)
             flag bits (4-byte number)
             destination basic block of arc #1 (4-byte number)
             flag bits (4-byte number)
             ...
             destination basic block of arc #N (4-byte number)
             flag bits (4-byte number)
             count of arcs in basic block #1 (4-byte number)
             destination basic block of arc #0 (4-byte number)
             flag bits (4-byte number)
             ...
</pre>
   <p>A &minus;1 (stored as a 4-byte number) is used to separate each function's
list of basic blocks, and to verify that the file has been read
correctly.

   <p>The function name is stored as a &minus;1 (4 bytes), the length (4 bytes),
the name itself (padded to 4-byte boundary) followed by a &minus;1 (4 bytes).

   <p>The flags are defined as follows:
     <ul>
<li>bit0
On function spanning tree

     <li>bit1
Is a fake edge

     <li>bit2
Is the fall through edge from one block to its immediate successor.

     <li>bit3-bit31
For future expansion

   </ul>

   <p>The <span class="file">.da</span> file is generated when a program containing object files
built with the GCC <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span> option is executed.  A
separate <span class="file">.da</span> file is created for each source file compiled with
this option, and the name of the <span class="file">.da</span> file is stored as an
absolute pathname in the resulting object file.  This path name is
derived from the object file name by substituting a <span class="file">.da</span> suffix.

   <p>The <span class="file">.da</span> consists of one or more blocks with the following
structure:
<pre class="smallexample">             "magic" number &minus;123 (4-byte number)
     	number of functions (4-byte number)
             length of the "extension block" in bytes
     	extension block (variable length)
       	name of function #0 (the same format as in .bbg file)
             checksum of function #0
     	number of instrumented arcs (4-byte number)
             count of arc #0 (8-byte number)
             count of arc #1 (8-byte number)
             ...
     	count of arc #M_0 (8-byte number)
       	name of function #1 (the same format as in .bbg file)
             checksum of function #1
     	...
</pre>
   <p>Multiple program runs might merge data into a single block, or might
append a new block. The current structure of the extension block is as
follows:
<pre class="smallexample">             number of instrumented arcs in whole program (4-byte number)
             sum all of instrumented arcs in whole program (8-byte number)
             maximal value of counter in whole program (8-byte number)
             number of instrumented arcs in the object file (4-byte number)
             sum all of instrumented arcs in the object file (8-byte number)
             maximal value of counter in the object file (8-byte number)
</pre>
   <p>All three of these files use the functions in <span class="file">gcov-io.h</span> to store
integers; the functions in this header provide a machine-independent
mechanism for storing and retrieving data from a stream.

     <ul>
<li>The <code>fixincludes</code> script interacts badly with automounters; if the
directory of system header files is automounted, it tends to be
unmounted while <code>fixincludes</code> is running.  This would seem to be a
bug in the automounter.  We don't know any good way to work around it.

     <li>The <code>fixproto</code> script will sometimes add prototypes for the
<code>sigsetjmp</code> and <code>siglongjmp</code> functions that reference the
<code>jmp_buf</code> type before that type is defined.  To work around this,
edit the offending file and place the typedef in front of the
prototypes.

<h3 class="section">10.2 Cross-Compiler Problems</h3>

<p>You may run into problems with cross compilation on certain machines,
for several reasons.

     <ul>
<li>Cross compilation can run into trouble for certain machines because
some target machines' assemblers require floating point numbers to be
written as <em>integer</em> constants in certain contexts.

     <p>The compiler writes these integer constants by examining the floating
point value as an integer and printing that integer, because this is
simple to write and independent of the details of the floating point
representation.  But this does not work if the compiler is running on
a different machine with an incompatible floating point format, or
even a different byte-ordering.

     <p>In addition, correct constant folding of floating point values
requires representing them in the target machine's format. 
(The C standard does not quite require this, but in practice
it is the only way to win.)

     <p>It is now possible to overcome these problems by defining macros such
as <code>REAL_VALUE_TYPE</code>.  But doing so is a substantial amount of
work for each target machine. 
See <a href="{No value for `fngccint'}.html#Cross_002dcompilation">Cross Compilation and Floating Point (GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals)</a>.

     <li>At present, the program <span class="file">mips-tfile</span> which adds debug
support to object files on MIPS systems does not work in a cross
compile environment.

<h3 class="section">10.3 Interoperation</h3>

<p>This section lists various difficulties encountered in using GCC
together with other compilers or with the assemblers, linkers,
libraries and debuggers on certain systems.

     <ul>
<li>On many platforms, GCC supports a different ABI for C++ than do other
compilers, so the object files compiled by GCC cannot be used with object
files generated by another C++ compiler.

     <p>An area where the difference is most apparent is name mangling.  The use
of different name mangling is intentional, to protect you from more subtle
problems. 
Compilers differ as to many internal details of C++ implementation,
including: how class instances are laid out, how multiple inheritance is
implemented, and how virtual function calls are handled.  If the name
encoding were made the same, your programs would link against libraries
provided from other compilers&mdash;but the programs would then crash when
run.  Incompatible libraries are then detected at link time, rather than
at run time.

     <li>Older GDB versions sometimes fail to read the output of GCC version
2.  If you have trouble, get GDB version 4.4 or later.

     <li><a name="index-DBX-1941"></a>DBX rejects some files produced by GCC, though it accepts similar
constructs in output from PCC.  Until someone can supply a coherent
description of what is valid DBX input and what is not, there is
nothing I can do about these problems.  You are on your own.

     <li>The GNU assembler (GAS) does not support PIC.  To generate PIC code, you
must use some other assembler, such as <span class="file">/bin/as</span>.

     <li>On some BSD systems, including some versions of Ultrix, use of profiling
causes static variable destructors (currently used only in C++) not to
be run.

     <li>On some SGI systems, when you use <span class="option">-lgl_s</span> as an option,
it gets translated magically to <span class="samp">-lgl_s -lX11_s -lc_s</span>. 
Naturally, this does not happen when you use GCC. 
You must specify all three options explicitly.

     <li>On a SPARC, GCC aligns all values of type <code>double</code> on an 8-byte
boundary, and it expects every <code>double</code> to be so aligned.  The Sun
compiler usually gives <code>double</code> values 8-byte alignment, with one
exception: function arguments of type <code>double</code> may not be aligned.

     <p>As a result, if a function compiled with Sun CC takes the address of an
argument of type <code>double</code> and passes this pointer of type
<code>double *</code> to a function compiled with GCC, dereferencing the
pointer may cause a fatal signal.

     <p>One way to solve this problem is to compile your entire program with GCC. 
Another solution is to modify the function that is compiled with
Sun CC to copy the argument into a local variable; local variables
are always properly aligned.  A third solution is to modify the function
that uses the pointer to dereference it via the following function
<code>access_double</code> instead of directly with <span class="samp">*</span>:

     <pre class="smallexample">          inline double
          access_double (double *unaligned_ptr)
          {
            union d2i { double d; int i[2]; };
          
            union d2i *p = (union d2i *) unaligned_ptr;
            union d2i u;
          
            u.i[0] = p-&gt;i[0];
            u.i[1] = p-&gt;i[1];
          
            return u.d;
          }
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">Storing into the pointer can be done likewise with the same union.

     <li>On Solaris, the <code>malloc</code> function in the <span class="file">libmalloc.a</span> library
may allocate memory that is only 4 byte aligned.  Since GCC on the
SPARC assumes that doubles are 8 byte aligned, this may result in a
fatal signal if doubles are stored in memory allocated by the
<span class="file">libmalloc.a</span> library.

     <p>The solution is to not use the <span class="file">libmalloc.a</span> library.  Use instead
<code>malloc</code> and related functions from <span class="file">libc.a</span>; they do not have
this problem.

     <li>Sun forgot to include a static version of <span class="file">libdl.a</span> with some
versions of SunOS (mainly 4.1).  This results in undefined symbols when
linking static binaries (that is, if you use <span class="option">-static</span>).  If you
see undefined symbols <code>_dlclose</code>, <code>_dlsym</code> or <code>_dlopen</code>
when linking, compile and link against the file
<span class="file">mit/util/misc/dlsym.c</span> from the MIT version of X windows.

     <li>The 128-bit long double format that the SPARC port supports currently
works by using the architecturally defined quad-word floating point
instructions.  Since there is no hardware that supports these
instructions they must be emulated by the operating system.  Long
doubles do not work in Sun OS versions 4.0.3 and earlier, because the
kernel emulator uses an obsolete and incompatible format.  Long doubles
do not work in Sun OS version 4.1.1 due to a problem in a Sun library. 
Long doubles do work on Sun OS versions 4.1.2 and higher, but GCC
does not enable them by default.  Long doubles appear to work in Sun OS
5.x (Solaris 2.x).

     <li>On HP-UX version 9.01 on the HP PA, the HP compiler <code>cc</code> does not
compile GCC correctly.  We do not yet know why.  However, GCC
compiled on earlier HP-UX versions works properly on HP-UX 9.01 and can
compile itself properly on 9.01.

     <li>On the HP PA machine, ADB sometimes fails to work on functions compiled
with GCC.  Specifically, it fails to work on functions that use
<code>alloca</code> or variable-size arrays.  This is because GCC doesn't
generate HP-UX unwind descriptors for such functions.  It may even be
impossible to generate them.

     <li>Debugging (<span class="option">-g</span>) is not supported on the HP PA machine, unless you use
the preliminary GNU tools.

     <li>Taking the address of a label may generate errors from the HP-UX
PA assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.

     <li>Using floating point parameters for indirect calls to static functions
will not work when using the HP assembler.  There simply is no way for GCC
to specify what registers hold arguments for static functions when using
the HP assembler.  GAS for the PA does not have this problem.

     <li>In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
receive errors from the HP linker complaining about an out of bounds
unconditional branch offset.  This used to occur more often in previous
versions of GCC, but is now exceptionally rare.  If you should run
into it, you can work around by making your function smaller.

     <li>GCC compiled code sometimes emits warnings from the HP-UX assembler of
the form:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (warning) Use of GR3 when
            frame &gt;= 8192 may cause conflict.
     </pre>
     <p>These warnings are harmless and can be safely ignored.

     <li>On the IBM RS/6000, compiling code of the form

     <pre class="smallexample">          extern int foo;
          
          ... foo ...
          
          static int foo;
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">will cause the linker to report an undefined symbol <code>foo</code>. 
Although this behavior differs from most other systems, it is not a
bug because redefining an <code>extern</code> variable as <code>static</code>
is undefined in ISO C.

     <li>In extremely rare cases involving some very large functions you may
receive errors from the AIX Assembler complaining about a displacement
that is too large.  If you should run into it, you can work around by
making your function smaller.

     <li>The <span class="file">libstdc++.a</span> library in GCC relies on the SVR4 dynamic
linker semantics which merges global symbols between libraries and
applications, especially necessary for C++ streams functionality. 
This is not the default behavior of AIX shared libraries and dynamic
linking.  <span class="file">libstdc++.a</span> is built on AIX with &ldquo;runtime-linking&rdquo;
enabled so that symbol merging can occur.  To utilize this feature,
the application linked with <span class="file">libstdc++.a</span> must include the
<span class="option">-Wl,-brtl</span> flag on the link line.  G++ cannot impose this
because this option may interfere with the semantics of the user
program and users may not always use <span class="samp">g++</span> to link his or her
application. Applications are not required to use the
<span class="option">-Wl,-brtl</span> flag on the link line&mdash;the rest of the
<span class="file">libstdc++.a</span> library which is not dependent on the symbol
merging semantics will continue to function correctly.

     <li>An application can interpose its own definition of functions for
functions invoked by <span class="file">libstdc++.a</span> with &ldquo;runtime-linking&rdquo;
enabled on AIX.  To accomplish this the application must be linked
with &ldquo;runtime-linking&rdquo; option and the functions explicitly must be
exported by the application (<span class="option">-Wl,-brtl,-bE:exportfile</span>).

     <li>AIX on the RS/6000 provides support (NLS) for environments outside of
the United States.  Compilers and assemblers use NLS to support
locale-specific representations of various objects including
floating-point numbers (<span class="samp">.</span> vs <span class="samp">,</span> for separating decimal
fractions). There have been problems reported where the library linked
with GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats that the
assembler accepts. If you have this problem, set the <span class="env">LANG</span>
environment variable to <span class="samp">C</span> or <span class="samp">En_US</span>.

     <li><a name="index-fdollars_002din_002didentifiers-1942"></a>Even if you specify <span class="option">-fdollars-in-identifiers</span>,
you cannot successfully use <span class="samp">$</span> in identifiers on the RS/6000 due
to a restriction in the IBM assembler.  GAS supports these
identifiers.

     <p><a name="index-VAX-calling-convention-1943"></a><a name="index-Ultrix-calling-convention-1944"></a><li><a name="index-fcall_002dsaved-1945"></a>On Ultrix, the Fortran compiler expects registers 2 through 5 to be saved
by function calls.  However, the C compiler uses conventions compatible
with BSD Unix: registers 2 through 5 may be clobbered by function calls.

     <p>GCC uses the same convention as the Ultrix C compiler.  You can use
these options to produce code compatible with the Fortran compiler:

     <pre class="smallexample">          -fcall-saved-r2 -fcall-saved-r3 -fcall-saved-r4 -fcall-saved-r5
     </pre>
     <li>On the Alpha, you may get assembler errors about invalid syntax as a
result of floating point constants.  This is due to a bug in the C
library functions <code>ecvt</code>, <code>fcvt</code> and <code>gcvt</code>.  Given valid
floating point numbers, they sometimes print <span class="samp">NaN</span>.

<h3 class="section">10.4 Problems Compiling Certain Programs</h3>

<!-- prevent bad page break with this line -->
<p>Certain programs have problems compiling.

     <ul>
<li>Parse errors may occur compiling X11 on a Decstation running Ultrix 4.2
because of problems in DEC's versions of the X11 header files
<span class="file">X11/Xlib.h</span> and <span class="file">X11/Xutil.h</span>.  People recommend adding
<span class="option">-I/usr/include/mit</span> to use the MIT versions of the header files,
or fixing the header files by adding this:

     <pre class="example">          #ifdef __STDC__
          #define NeedFunctionPrototypes 0
          #endif
     </pre>
     <li>On various 386 Unix systems derived from System V, including SCO, ISC,
and ESIX, you may get error messages about running out of virtual memory
while compiling certain programs.

     <p>You can prevent this problem by linking GCC with the GNU malloc
(which thus replaces the malloc that comes with the system).  GNU malloc
is available as a separate package, and also in the file
<span class="file">src/gmalloc.c</span> in the GNU Emacs 19 distribution.

     <p>If you have installed GNU malloc as a separate library package, use this
option when you relink GCC:

     <pre class="example">          MALLOC=/usr/local/lib/libgmalloc.a
     </pre>
     <p>Alternatively, if you have compiled <span class="file">gmalloc.c</span> from Emacs 19, copy
the object file to <span class="file">gmalloc.o</span> and use this option when you relink
GCC:

     <pre class="example">          MALLOC=gmalloc.o
     </pre>
     </ul>

<h3 class="section">10.5 Incompatibilities of GCC</h3>

<p><a name="index-incompatibilities-of-GCC-1946"></a><a name="index-traditional-1947"></a>
There are several noteworthy incompatibilities between GNU C and K&amp;R
(non-ISO) versions of C.

     
<a name="index-string-constants-1948"></a>
<a name="index-read_002donly-strings-1949"></a>
<a name="index-shared-strings-1950"></a>
<ul><li>GCC normally makes string constants read-only.  If several
identical-looking string constants are used, GCC stores only one
copy of the string.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bmktemp_007d_002c-and-constant-strings-1951"></a>One consequence is that you cannot call <code>mktemp</code> with a string
constant argument.  The function <code>mktemp</code> always alters the
string its argument points to.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bsscanf_007d_002c-and-constant-strings-1952"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bfscanf_007d_002c-and-constant-strings-1953"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007bscanf_007d_002c-and-constant-strings-1954"></a>Another consequence is that <code>sscanf</code> does not work on some systems
when passed a string constant as its format control string or input. 
This is because <code>sscanf</code> incorrectly tries to write into the string
constant.  Likewise <code>fscanf</code> and <code>scanf</code>.

     <p><a name="index-fwritable_002dstrings-1955"></a>The best solution to these problems is to change the program to use
<code>char</code>-array variables with initialization strings for these
purposes instead of string constants.  But if this is not possible,
you can use the <span class="option">-fwritable-strings</span> flag, which directs GCC
to handle string constants the same way most C compilers do.

     <li><code>-2147483648</code> is positive.

     <p>This is because 2147483648 cannot fit in the type <code>int</code>, so
(following the ISO C rules) its data type is <code>unsigned long int</code>. 
Negating this value yields 2147483648 again.

     <li>GCC does not substitute macro arguments when they appear inside of
string constants.  For example, the following macro in GCC

     <pre class="example">          #define foo(a) "a"
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">will produce output <code>"a"</code> regardless of what the argument <var>a</var> is.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bsetjmp_007d-incompatibilities-1956"></a><a name="index-_0040code_007blongjmp_007d-incompatibilities-1957"></a><li>When you use <code>setjmp</code> and <code>longjmp</code>, the only automatic
variables guaranteed to remain valid are those declared
<code>volatile</code>.  This is a consequence of automatic register
allocation.  Consider this function:

     <pre class="example">          jmp_buf j;
          
          foo ()
          {
            int a, b;
          
            a = fun1 ();
            if (setjmp (j))
              return a;
          
            a = fun2 ();
            /* <code>longjmp (j)</code><span class="roman"> may occur in </span><code>fun3</code><span class="roman">.</span> */
            return a + fun3 ();
          }
     </pre>
     <p>Here <code>a</code> may or may not be restored to its first value when the
<code>longjmp</code> occurs.  If <code>a</code> is allocated in a register, then
its first value is restored; otherwise, it keeps the last value stored
in it.

     <p><a name="index-W-1958"></a>If you use the <span class="option">-W</span> option with the <span class="option">-O</span> option, you will
get a warning when GCC thinks such a problem might be possible.

     <li>Programs that use preprocessing directives in the middle of macro
arguments do not work with GCC.  For example, a program like this
will not work:

     <pre class="example">          foobar (
          #define luser
                  hack)
     </pre>
     <p>ISO C does not permit such a construct.

     <li>K&amp;R compilers allow comments to cross over an inclusion boundary
(i.e. started in an include file and ended in the including file).  I think
this would be quite ugly and can't imagine it could be needed.

     <p><a name="index-external-declaration-scope-1959"></a><a name="index-scope-of-external-declarations-1960"></a><a name="index-declaration-scope-1961"></a><li>Declarations of external variables and functions within a block apply
only to the block containing the declaration.  In other words, they
have the same scope as any other declaration in the same place.

     <p>In some other C compilers, a <code>extern</code> declaration affects all the
rest of the file even if it happens within a block.

     <li>In traditional C, you can combine <code>long</code>, etc., with a typedef name,
as shown here:

     <pre class="example">          typedef int foo;
          typedef long foo bar;
     </pre>
     <p>In ISO C, this is not allowed: <code>long</code> and other type modifiers
require an explicit <code>int</code>.

     <p><a name="index-typedef-names-as-function-parameters-1962"></a><li>PCC allows typedef names to be used as function parameters.

     <li>Traditional C allows the following erroneous pair of declarations to
appear together in a given scope:

     <pre class="example">          typedef int foo;
          typedef foo foo;
     </pre>
     <li>GCC treats all characters of identifiers as significant.  According to
K&amp;R-1 (2.2), &ldquo;No more than the first eight characters are significant,
although more may be used.&rdquo;.  Also according to K&amp;R-1 (2.2), &ldquo;An
identifier is a sequence of letters and digits; the first character must
be a letter.  The underscore _ counts as a letter.&rdquo;, but GCC also
allows dollar signs in identifiers.

     <p><a name="index-whitespace-1963"></a><li>PCC allows whitespace in the middle of compound assignment operators
such as <span class="samp">+=</span>.  GCC, following the ISO standard, does not
allow this.

     <p><a name="index-apostrophes-1964"></a><a name="index-_0027-1965"></a><li>GCC complains about unterminated character constants inside of
preprocessing conditionals that fail.  Some programs have English
comments enclosed in conditionals that are guaranteed to fail; if these
comments contain apostrophes, GCC will probably report an error.  For
example, this code would produce an error:

     <pre class="example">          #if 0
          You can't expect this to work.
          #endif
     </pre>
     <p>The best solution to such a problem is to put the text into an actual
C comment delimited by <span class="samp">/*...*/</span>.

     <li>Many user programs contain the declaration <span class="samp">long time ();</span>.  In the
past, the system header files on many systems did not actually declare
<code>time</code>, so it did not matter what type your program declared it to
return.  But in systems with ISO C headers, <code>time</code> is declared to
return <code>time_t</code>, and if that is not the same as <code>long</code>, then
<span class="samp">long time ();</span> is erroneous.

     <p>The solution is to change your program to use appropriate system headers
(<code>&lt;time.h&gt;</code> on systems with ISO C headers) and not to declare
<code>time</code> if the system header files declare it, or failing that to
use <code>time_t</code> as the return type of <code>time</code>.

     <p><a name="index-_0040code_007bfloat_007d-as-function-value-type-1966"></a><li>When compiling functions that return <code>float</code>, PCC converts it to
a double.  GCC actually returns a <code>float</code>.  If you are concerned
with PCC compatibility, you should declare your functions to return
<code>double</code>; you might as well say what you mean.

     <p><a name="index-structures-1967"></a><a name="index-unions-1968"></a><li>When compiling functions that return structures or unions, GCC
output code normally uses a method different from that used on most
versions of Unix.  As a result, code compiled with GCC cannot call
a structure-returning function compiled with PCC, and vice versa.

     <p>The method used by GCC is as follows: a structure or union which is
1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes long is returned like a scalar.  A structure or union
with any other size is stored into an address supplied by the caller
(usually in a special, fixed register, but on some machines it is passed
on the stack).  The machine-description macros <code>STRUCT_VALUE</code> and
<code>STRUCT_INCOMING_VALUE</code> tell GCC where to pass this address.

     <p>By contrast, PCC on most target machines returns structures and unions
of any size by copying the data into an area of static storage, and then
returning the address of that storage as if it were a pointer value. 
The caller must copy the data from that memory area to the place where
the value is wanted.  GCC does not use this method because it is
slower and nonreentrant.

     <p>On some newer machines, PCC uses a reentrant convention for all
structure and union returning.  GCC on most of these machines uses a
compatible convention when returning structures and unions in memory,
but still returns small structures and unions in registers.

     <p><a name="index-fpcc_002dstruct_002dreturn-1969"></a>You can tell GCC to use a compatible convention for all structure and
union returning with the option <span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span>.

     <p><a name="index-preprocessing-tokens-1970"></a><a name="index-preprocessing-numbers-1971"></a><li>GCC complains about program fragments such as <span class="samp">0x74ae-0x4000</span>
which appear to be two hexadecimal constants separated by the minus
operator.  Actually, this string is a single <dfn>preprocessing token</dfn>. 
Each such token must correspond to one token in C.  Since this does not,
GCC prints an error message.  Although it may appear obvious that what
is meant is an operator and two values, the ISO C standard specifically
requires that this be treated as erroneous.

     <p>A <dfn>preprocessing token</dfn> is a <dfn>preprocessing number</dfn> if it
begins with a digit and is followed by letters, underscores, digits,
periods and <span class="samp">e+</span>, <span class="samp">e-</span>, <span class="samp">E+</span>, <span class="samp">E-</span>, <span class="samp">p+</span>,
<span class="samp">p-</span>, <span class="samp">P+</span>, or <span class="samp">P-</span> character sequences.  (In strict C89
mode, the sequences <span class="samp">p+</span>, <span class="samp">p-</span>, <span class="samp">P+</span> and <span class="samp">P-</span> cannot
appear in preprocessing numbers.)

     <p>To make the above program fragment valid, place whitespace in front of
the minus sign.  This whitespace will end the preprocessing number.

<h3 class="section">10.6 Fixed Header Files</h3>

<p>GCC needs to install corrected versions of some system header files. 
This is because most target systems have some header files that won't
work with GCC unless they are changed.  Some have bugs, some are
incompatible with ISO C, and some depend on special features of other
compilers.

   <p>Installing GCC automatically creates and installs the fixed header
files, by running a program called <code>fixincludes</code> (or for certain
targets an alternative such as <code>fixinc.svr4</code>).  Normally, you
don't need to pay attention to this.  But there are cases where it
doesn't do the right thing automatically.

     <ul>
<li>If you update the system's header files, such as by installing a new
system version, the fixed header files of GCC are not automatically
updated.  The easiest way to update them is to reinstall GCC.  (If
you want to be clever, look in the makefile and you can find a
shortcut.)

     <li>On some systems, in particular SunOS 4, header file directories contain
machine-specific symbolic links in certain places.  This makes it
possible to share most of the header files among hosts running the
same version of SunOS 4 on different machine models.

     <p>The programs that fix the header files do not understand this special
way of using symbolic links; therefore, the directory of fixed header
files is good only for the machine model used to build it.

     <p>In SunOS 4, only programs that look inside the kernel will notice the
difference between machine models.  Therefore, for most purposes, you
need not be concerned about this.

     <p>It is possible to make separate sets of fixed header files for the
different machine models, and arrange a structure of symbolic links so
as to use the proper set, but you'll have to do this by hand.

     <li>On Lynxos, GCC by default does not fix the header files.  This is
because bugs in the shell cause the <code>fixincludes</code> script to fail.

     <p>This means you will encounter problems due to bugs in the system header
files.  It may be no comfort that they aren't GCC's fault, but it
does mean that there's nothing for us to do about them. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">10.7 Standard Libraries</h3>

<p><a name="index-Wall-1972"></a>GCC by itself attempts to be a conforming freestanding implementation. 
See <a href="#Standards">Language Standards Supported by GCC</a>, for details of
what this means.  Beyond the library facilities required of such an
implementation, the rest of the C library is supplied by the vendor of
the operating system.  If that C library doesn't conform to the C
standards, then your programs might get warnings (especially when using
<span class="option">-Wall</span>) that you don't expect.

   <p>For example, the <code>sprintf</code> function on SunOS 4.1.3 returns
<code>char *</code> while the C standard says that <code>sprintf</code> returns an
<code>int</code>.  The <code>fixincludes</code> program could make the prototype for
this function match the Standard, but that would be wrong, since the
function will still return <code>char *</code>.

   <p>If you need a Standard compliant library, then you need to find one, as
GCC does not provide one.  The GNU C library (called <code>glibc</code>)
provides ISO C, POSIX, BSD, SystemV and X/Open compatibility for
GNU/Linux and HURD-based GNU systems; no recent version of it supports
other systems, though some very old versions did.  Version 2.2 of the
GNU C library includes nearly complete C99 support.  You could also ask
your operating system vendor if newer libraries are available.

<h3 class="section">10.8 Disappointments and Misunderstandings</h3>

<p>These problems are perhaps regrettable, but we don't know any practical
way around them.

     <ul>
<li>Certain local variables aren't recognized by debuggers when you compile
with optimization.

     <p>This occurs because sometimes GCC optimizes the variable out of
existence.  There is no way to tell the debugger how to compute the
value such a variable &ldquo;would have had&rdquo;, and it is not clear that would
be desirable anyway.  So GCC simply does not mention the eliminated
variable when it writes debugging information.

     <p>You have to expect a certain amount of disagreement between the
executable and your source code, when you use optimization.

     <p><a name="index-conflicting-types-1973"></a><a name="index-scope-of-declaration-1974"></a><li>Users often think it is a bug when GCC reports an error for code
like this:

     <pre class="example">          int foo (struct mumble *);
          
          struct mumble { ... };
          
          int foo (struct mumble *x)
          { ... }
     </pre>
     <p>This code really is erroneous, because the scope of <code>struct
mumble</code> in the prototype is limited to the argument list containing it. 
It does not refer to the <code>struct mumble</code> defined with file scope
immediately below&mdash;they are two unrelated types with similar names in
different scopes.

     <p>But in the definition of <code>foo</code>, the file-scope type is used
because that is available to be inherited.  Thus, the definition and
the prototype do not match, and you get an error.

     <p>This behavior may seem silly, but it's what the ISO standard specifies. 
It is easy enough for you to make your code work by moving the
definition of <code>struct mumble</code> above the prototype.  It's not worth
being incompatible with ISO C just to avoid an error for the example
shown above.

     <li>Accesses to bit-fields even in volatile objects works by accessing larger
objects, such as a byte or a word.  You cannot rely on what size of
object is accessed in order to read or write the bit-field; it may even
vary for a given bit-field according to the precise usage.

     <p>If you care about controlling the amount of memory that is accessed, use
volatile but do not use bit-fields.

     <li>GCC comes with shell scripts to fix certain known problems in system
header files.  They install corrected copies of various header files in
a special directory where only GCC will normally look for them.  The
scripts adapt to various systems by searching all the system header
files for the problem cases that we know about.

     <p>If new system header files are installed, nothing automatically arranges
to update the corrected header files.  You will have to reinstall GCC
to fix the new header files.  More specifically, go to the build
directory and delete the files <span class="file">stmp-fixinc</span> and
<span class="file">stmp-headers</span>, and the subdirectory <code>include</code>; then do
<span class="samp">make install</span> again.

     <li><a name="index-floating-point-precision-1975"></a>On 68000 and x86 systems, for instance, you can get paradoxical results
if you test the precise values of floating point numbers.  For example,
you can find that a floating point value which is not a NaN is not equal
to itself.  This results from the fact that the floating point registers
hold a few more bits of precision than fit in a <code>double</code> in memory. 
Compiled code moves values between memory and floating point registers
at its convenience, and moving them into memory truncates them.

     <p><a name="index-ffloat_002dstore-1976"></a>You can partially avoid this problem by using the <span class="option">-ffloat-store</span>
option (see <a href="#Optimize-Options">Optimize Options</a>).

     <li>On AIX and other platforms without weak symbol support, templates
need to be instantiated explicitly and symbols for static members
of templates will not be generated.

     <li>On AIX, GCC scans object files and library archives for static
constructors and destructors when linking an application before the
linker prunes unreferenced symbols.  This is necessary to prevent the
AIX linker from mistakenly assuming that static constructor or
destructor are unused and removing them before the scanning can occur. 
All static constructors and destructors found will be referenced even
though the modules in which they occur may not be used by the program. 
This may lead to both increased executable size and unexpected symbol
references.

the static member; you must also <em>define</em> it.  For example:

<pre class="example">     class Foo
     {
       ...
       void method();
       static int bar;
     };
</pre>
   <p>This declaration only establishes that the class <code>Foo</code> has an
<code>int</code> named <code>Foo::bar</code>, and a member function named
<code>Foo::method</code>.  But you still need to define <em>both</em>
<code>method</code> and <code>bar</code> elsewhere.  According to the ISO
standard, you must supply an initializer in one (and only one) source

<p><a name="index-temporaries_002c-lifetime-of-1984"></a><a name="index-portions-of-temporary-objects_002c-pointers-to-1985"></a>It is dangerous to use pointers or references to <em>portions</em> of a
temporary object.  The compiler may very well delete the object before
you expect it to, leaving a pointer to garbage.  The most common place
where this problem crops up is in classes like string classes,
especially ones that define a conversion function to type <code>char *</code>
or <code>const char *</code>&mdash;which is one reason why the standard
<code>string</code> class requires you to call the <code>c_str</code> member
function.  However, any class that returns a pointer to some internal
structure is potentially subject to this problem.

   <p>For example, a program may use a function <code>strfunc</code> that returns
<code>string</code> objects, and another function <code>charfunc</code> that
operates on pointers to <code>char</code>:

<pre class="example">     string strfunc ();
     void charfunc (const char *);
     
     void
     f ()
     {
       const char *p = strfunc().c_str();
       ...
       charfunc (p);
       ...
       charfunc (p);
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">In this situation, it may seem reasonable to save a pointer to the C
string returned by the <code>c_str</code> member function and use that rather
than call <code>c_str</code> repeatedly.  However, the temporary string
created by the call to <code>strfunc</code> is destroyed after <code>p</code> is
initialized, at which point <code>p</code> is left pointing to freed memory.

   <p>Code like this may run successfully under some other compilers,
particularly obsolete cfront-based compilers that delete temporaries
along with normal local variables.  However, the GNU C++ behavior is
standard-conforming, so if your program depends on late destruction of
temporaries it is not portable.

   <p>The safe way to write such code is to give the temporary a name, which
forces it to remain until the end of the scope of the name.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     const string&amp; tmp = strfunc ();
     charfunc (tmp.c_str ());
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">10.9.3 Implicit Copy-Assignment for Virtual Bases</h4>

<p>When a base class is virtual, only one subobject of the base class
belongs to each full object.  Also, the constructors and destructors are
invoked only once, and called from the most-derived class.  However, such
objects behave unspecified when being assigned.  For example:

<pre class="example">     struct Base{
       char *name;
       Base(char *n) : name(strdup(n)){}
       Base&amp; operator= (const Base&amp; other){
        free (name);
        name = strdup (other.name);
       }
     };
     
     struct A:virtual Base{
       int val;
       A():Base("A"){}
     };
     
     struct B:virtual Base{
       int bval;
       B():Base("B"){}
     };
     
     struct Derived:public A, public B{
       Derived():Base("Derived"){}
     };
     
     void func(Derived &amp;d1, Derived &amp;d2)
     {
       d1 = d2;
     }
</pre>
   <p>The C++ standard specifies that <span class="samp">Base::Base</span> is only called once
when constructing or copy-constructing a Derived object.  It is
unspecified whether <span class="samp">Base::operator=</span> is called more than once when
the implicit copy-assignment for Derived objects is invoked (as it is
inside <span class="samp">func</span> in the example).

   <p>g++ implements the &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; algorithm for copy-assignment: assign all
direct bases, then assign all members.  In that algorithm, the virtual
base subobject can be encountered more than once.  In the example, copying
proceeds in the following order: <span class="samp">val</span>, <span class="samp">name</span> (via
<code>strdup</code>), <span class="samp">bval</span>, and <span class="samp">name</span> again.

   <p>If application code relies on copy-assignment, a user-defined
copy-assignment operator removes any uncertainties.  With such an
operator, the application can define whether and how the virtual base
subobject is assigned.

<h3 class="section">10.10 Caveats of using <span class="command">protoize</span></h3>

<p>The conversion programs <span class="command">protoize</span> and <span class="command">unprotoize</span> can
sometimes change a source file in a way that won't work unless you
rearrange it.

     <ul>
<li><span class="command">protoize</span> can insert references to a type name or type tag before
the definition, or in a file where they are not defined.

     <p>If this happens, compiler error messages should show you where the new
references are, so fixing the file by hand is straightforward.

     <li>There are some C constructs which <span class="command">protoize</span> cannot figure out. 
For example, it can't determine argument types for declaring a
pointer-to-function variable; this you must do by hand.  <span class="command">protoize</span>
inserts a comment containing <span class="samp">???</span> each time it finds such a
variable; so you can find all such variables by searching for this
string.  ISO C does not require declaring the argument types of
pointer-to-function types.

     <li>Using <span class="command">unprotoize</span> can easily introduce bugs.  If the program
relied on prototypes to bring about conversion of arguments, these
conversions will not take place in the program without prototypes. 
One case in which you can be sure <span class="command">unprotoize</span> is safe is when
you are removing prototypes that were made with <span class="command">protoize</span>; if
the program worked before without any prototypes, it will work again
without them.

     <p><a name="index-Wconversion-1986"></a>You can find all the places where this problem might occur by compiling
the program with the <span class="option">-Wconversion</span> option.  It prints a warning
whenever an argument is converted.

     <li>Both conversion programs can be confused if there are macro calls in and
around the text to be converted.  In other words, the standard syntax
for a declaration or definition must not result from expanding a macro. 
This problem is inherent in the design of C and cannot be fixed.  If
only a few functions have confusing macro calls, you can easily convert
them manually.

     <li><span class="command">protoize</span> cannot get the argument types for a function whose
definition was not actually compiled due to preprocessing conditionals. 
When this happens, <span class="command">protoize</span> changes nothing in regard to such
a function.  <span class="command">protoize</span> tries to detect such instances and warn
about them.

     <p>You can generally work around this problem by using <span class="command">protoize</span> step
by step, each time specifying a different set of <span class="option">-D</span> options for
compilation, until all of the functions have been converted.  There is
no automatic way to verify that you have got them all, however.

     <li>Confusion may result if there is an occasion to convert a function
declaration or definition in a region of source code where there is more
than one formal parameter list present.  Thus, attempts to convert code
containing multiple (conditionally compiled) versions of a single
function header (in the same vicinity) may not produce the desired (or
expected) results.

     <p>If you plan on converting source files which contain such code, it is
recommended that you first make sure that each conditionally compiled
region of source code which contains an alternative function header also
contains at least one additional follower token (past the final right
parenthesis of the function header).  This should circumvent the
problem.

     <li><span class="command">unprotoize</span> can become confused when trying to convert a function
definition or declaration which contains a declaration for a
pointer-to-function formal argument which has the same name as the
function being defined or declared.  We recommend you avoid such choices
of formal parameter names.

     <li>You might also want to correct some of the indentation by hand and break
long lines.  (The conversion programs don't write lines longer than
eighty characters in any case.)

<h3 class="section">10.11 Certain Changes We Don't Want to Make</h3>

<p>This section lists changes that people frequently request, but which
we do not make because we think GCC is better without them.

     <ul>
<li>Checking the number and type of arguments to a function which has an
old-fashioned definition and no prototype.

     <p>Such a feature would work only occasionally&mdash;only for calls that appear
in the same file as the called function, following the definition.  The
only way to check all calls reliably is to add a prototype for the
function.  But adding a prototype eliminates the motivation for this
feature.  So the feature is not worthwhile.

     <li>Warning about using an expression whose type is signed as a shift count.

     <p>Shift count operands are probably signed more often than unsigned. 
Warning about this would cause far more annoyance than good.

     <li>Warning about assigning a signed value to an unsigned variable.

     <p>Such assignments must be very common; warning about them would cause
more annoyance than good.

     <li>Warning when a non-void function value is ignored.

     <p>Coming as I do from a Lisp background, I balk at the idea that there is
something dangerous about discarding a value.  There are functions that
return values which some callers may find useful; it makes no sense to
clutter the program with a cast to <code>void</code> whenever the value isn't
useful.

     <li><a name="index-fshort_002denums-1987"></a>Making <span class="option">-fshort-enums</span> the default.

     <p>This would cause storage layout to be incompatible with most other C
compilers.  And it doesn't seem very important, given that you can get
the same result in other ways.  The case where it matters most is when
the enumeration-valued object is inside a structure, and in that case
you can specify a field width explicitly.

     <li>Making bit-fields unsigned by default on particular machines where &ldquo;the
ABI standard&rdquo; says to do so.

     <p>The ISO C standard leaves it up to the implementation whether a bit-field
declared plain <code>int</code> is signed or not.  This in effect creates two
alternative dialects of C.

     <p><a name="index-fsigned_002dbitfields-1988"></a><a name="index-funsigned_002dbitfields-1989"></a>The GNU C compiler supports both dialects; you can specify the signed
dialect with <span class="option">-fsigned-bitfields</span> and the unsigned dialect with
<span class="option">-funsigned-bitfields</span>.  However, this leaves open the question of
which dialect to use by default.

     <p>Currently, the preferred dialect makes plain bit-fields signed, because
this is simplest.  Since <code>int</code> is the same as <code>signed int</code> in
every other context, it is cleanest for them to be the same in bit-fields
as well.

     <p>Some computer manufacturers have published Application Binary Interface
standards which specify that plain bit-fields should be unsigned.  It is
a mistake, however, to say anything about this issue in an ABI.  This is
because the handling of plain bit-fields distinguishes two dialects of C. 
Both dialects are meaningful on every type of machine.  Whether a
particular object file was compiled using signed bit-fields or unsigned
is of no concern to other object files, even if they access the same
bit-fields in the same data structures.

     <p>A given program is written in one or the other of these two dialects. 
The program stands a chance to work on most any machine if it is
compiled with the proper dialect.  It is unlikely to work at all if
compiled with the wrong dialect.

     <p>Many users appreciate the GNU C compiler because it provides an
environment that is uniform across machines.  These users would be
inconvenienced if the compiler treated plain bit-fields differently on
certain machines.

     <p>Occasionally users write programs intended only for a particular machine
type.  On these occasions, the users would benefit if the GNU C compiler
were to support by default the same dialect as the other compilers on
that machine.  But such applications are rare.  And users writing a
program to run on more than one type of machine cannot possibly benefit
from this kind of compatibility.

     <p>This is why GCC does and will treat plain bit-fields in the same
fashion on all types of machines (by default).

     <p>There are some arguments for making bit-fields unsigned by default on all
machines.  If, for example, this becomes a universal de facto standard,
it would make sense for GCC to go along with it.  This is something
to be considered in the future.

     <p>(Of course, users strongly concerned about portability should indicate
explicitly in each bit-field whether it is signed or not.  In this way,
they write programs which have the same meaning in both C dialects.)

     <li><a name="index-ansi-1990"></a><a name="index-std-1991"></a>Undefining <code>__STDC__</code> when <span class="option">-ansi</span> is not used.

     <p>Currently, GCC defines <code>__STDC__</code> unconditionally.  This provides
good results in practice.

     <p>Programmers normally use conditionals on <code>__STDC__</code> to ask whether
it is safe to use certain features of ISO C, such as function
prototypes or ISO token concatenation.  Since plain <span class="command">gcc</span> supports
all the features of ISO C, the correct answer to these questions is
&ldquo;yes&rdquo;.

     <p>Some users try to use <code>__STDC__</code> to check for the availability of
certain library facilities.  This is actually incorrect usage in an ISO
C program, because the ISO C standard says that a conforming
freestanding implementation should define <code>__STDC__</code> even though it
does not have the library facilities.  <span class="samp">gcc -ansi -pedantic</span> is a
conforming freestanding implementation, and it is therefore required to
define <code>__STDC__</code>, even though it does not come with an ISO C
library.

     <p>Sometimes people say that defining <code>__STDC__</code> in a compiler that
does not completely conform to the ISO C standard somehow violates the
standard.  This is illogical.  The standard is a standard for compilers
that claim to support ISO C, such as <span class="samp">gcc -ansi</span>&mdash;not for other
compilers such as plain <span class="command">gcc</span>.  Whatever the ISO C standard says
is relevant to the design of plain <span class="command">gcc</span> without <span class="option">-ansi</span> only
for pragmatic reasons, not as a requirement.

     <p>GCC normally defines <code>__STDC__</code> to be 1, and in addition
defines <code>__STRICT_ANSI__</code> if you specify the <span class="option">-ansi</span> option,
or a <span class="option">-std</span> option for strict conformance to some version of ISO C. 
On some hosts, system include files use a different convention, where
<code>__STDC__</code> is normally 0, but is 1 if the user specifies strict
conformance to the C Standard.  GCC follows the host convention when
processing system include files, but when processing user files it follows
the usual GNU C convention.

     <li>Undefining <code>__STDC__</code> in C++.

     <p>Programs written to compile with C++-to-C translators get the
value of <code>__STDC__</code> that goes with the C compiler that is
subsequently used.  These programs must test <code>__STDC__</code>
to determine what kind of C preprocessor that compiler uses:
whether they should concatenate tokens in the ISO C fashion
or in the traditional fashion.

     <p>These programs work properly with GNU C++ if <code>__STDC__</code> is defined. 
They would not work otherwise.

     <p>In addition, many header files are written to provide prototypes in ISO
C but not in traditional C.  Many of these header files can work without
change in C++ provided <code>__STDC__</code> is defined.  If <code>__STDC__</code>
is not defined, they will all fail, and will all need to be changed to
test explicitly for C++ as well.

     <li>Deleting &ldquo;empty&rdquo; loops.

     <p>Historically, GCC has not deleted &ldquo;empty&rdquo; loops under the
assumption that the most likely reason you would put one in a program is
to have a delay, so deleting them will not make real programs run any
faster.

     <p>However, the rationale here is that optimization of a nonempty loop
cannot produce an empty one, which holds for C but is not always the
case for C++.

     <p><a name="index-funroll_002dloops-1992"></a>Moreover, with <span class="option">-funroll-loops</span> small &ldquo;empty&rdquo; loops are already
removed, so the current behavior is both sub-optimal and inconsistent
and will change in the future.

     <li>Making side effects happen in the same order as in some other compiler.

     <p><a name="index-side-effects_002c-order-of-evaluation-1993"></a><a name="index-order-of-evaluation_002c-side-effects-1994"></a>It is never safe to depend on the order of evaluation of side effects. 
For example, a function call like this may very well behave differently
from one compiler to another:

     <pre class="example">          void func (int, int);
          
          int i = 2;
          func (i++, i++);
     </pre>
     <p>There is no guarantee (in either the C or the C++ standard language
definitions) that the increments will be evaluated in any particular
order.  Either increment might happen first.  <code>func</code> might get the
arguments <span class="samp">2, 3</span>, or it might get <span class="samp">3, 2</span>, or even <span class="samp">2, 2</span>.

     <li>Not allowing structures with volatile fields in registers.

     <p>Strictly speaking, there is no prohibition in the ISO C standard
against allowing structures with volatile fields in registers, but
it does not seem to make any sense and is probably not what you wanted
to do.  So the compiler will give an error message in this case.

     <li>Making certain warnings into errors by default.

     <p>Some ISO C testsuites report failure when the compiler does not produce
an error message for a certain program.

     <p><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-1995"></a>ISO C requires a &ldquo;diagnostic&rdquo; message for certain kinds of invalid
programs, but a warning is defined by GCC to count as a diagnostic.  If
GCC produces a warning but not an error, that is correct ISO C support. 
If test suites call this &ldquo;failure&rdquo;, they should be run with the GCC
option <span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span>, which will turn these warnings into
errors.

<h3 class="section">10.12 Warning Messages and Error Messages</h3>

<p><a name="index-error-messages-1996"></a><a name="index-warnings-vs-errors-1997"></a><a name="index-messages_002c-warning-and-error-1998"></a>The GNU compiler can produce two kinds of diagnostics: errors and
warnings.  Each kind has a different purpose:

     <ul>
<li><dfn>Errors</dfn> report problems that make it impossible to compile your
program.  GCC reports errors with the source file name and line
number where the problem is apparent.

     <li><dfn>Warnings</dfn> report other unusual conditions in your code that
<em>may</em> indicate a problem, although compilation can (and does)
proceed.  Warning messages also report the source file name and line
number, but include the text <span class="samp">warning:</span> to distinguish them
from error messages. 
</ul>

   <p>Warnings may indicate danger points where you should check to make sure
that your program really does what you intend; or the use of obsolete
features; or the use of nonstandard features of GNU C or C++.  Many
warnings are issued only if you ask for them, with one of the <span class="option">-W</span>
options (for instance, <span class="option">-Wall</span> requests a variety of useful
warnings).

   <p><a name="index-pedantic-1999"></a><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-2000"></a>GCC always tries to compile your program if possible; it never
gratuitously rejects a program whose meaning is clear merely because
(for instance) it fails to conform to a standard.  In some cases,
however, the C and C++ standards specify that certain extensions are
forbidden, and a diagnostic <em>must</em> be issued by a conforming
compiler.  The <span class="option">-pedantic</span> option tells GCC to issue warnings in
such cases; <span class="option">-pedantic-errors</span> says to make them errors instead. 
This does not mean that <em>all</em> non-ISO constructs get warnings
or errors.

   <p>See <a href="#Warning-Options">Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</a>, for
more detail on these and related command-line options.

<h3 class="section">11.1 Have You Found a Bug?</h3>

<p><a name="index-bug-criteria-2003"></a>
If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some guidelines:

     
<a name="index-fatal-signal-2004"></a>
<a name="index-core-dump-2005"></a>
<ul><li>If the compiler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that is a
compiler bug.  Reliable compilers never crash.

     <p><a name="index-invalid-assembly-code-2006"></a><a name="index-assembly-code_002c-invalid-2007"></a><li>If the compiler produces invalid assembly code, for any input whatever
(except an <code>asm</code> statement), that is a compiler bug, unless the
compiler reports errors (not just warnings) which would ordinarily
prevent the assembler from being run.

     <p><a name="index-undefined-behavior-2008"></a><a name="index-undefined-function-value-2009"></a><a name="index-increment-operators-2010"></a><li>If the compiler produces valid assembly code that does not correctly
execute the input source code, that is a compiler bug.

     <p>However, you must double-check to make sure, because you may have a
program whose behavior is undefined, which happened by chance to give
the desired results with another C or C++ compiler.

     <p>For example, in many nonoptimizing compilers, you can write <span class="samp">x;</span>
at the end of a function instead of <span class="samp">return x;</span>, with the same
results.  But the value of the function is undefined if <code>return</code>
is omitted; it is not a bug when GCC produces different results.

     <p>Problems often result from expressions with two increment operators,
as in <code>f (*p++, *p++)</code>.  Your previous compiler might have
interpreted that expression the way you intended; GCC might
interpret it another way.  Neither compiler is wrong.  The bug is
in your code.

     <p>After you have localized the error to a single source line, it should
be easy to check for these things.  If your program is correct and
well defined, you have found a compiler bug.

     <li>If the compiler produces an error message for valid input, that is a
compiler bug.

     <p><a name="index-invalid-input-2011"></a><li>If the compiler does not produce an error message for invalid input,
that is a compiler bug.  However, you should note that your idea of
&ldquo;invalid input&rdquo; might be my idea of &ldquo;an extension&rdquo; or &ldquo;support
for traditional practice&rdquo;.

     <li>If you are an experienced user of one of the languages GCC supports, your
suggestions for improvement of GCC are welcome in any case.

<p>If you need help installing, using or changing GCC, there are two

<h2 class="unnumbered">Funding Free Software</h2>

<p>If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes
sense for you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its
development.  The most effective approach known is to encourage
commercial redistributors to donate.

   <p>Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development by
encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
to free software developers&mdash;the Free Software Foundation, and others.

   <p>The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and expect
it from them.  So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
how much they give to free software development.  Show distributors
they must compete to be the one who gives the most.

   <p>To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you can
compare, such as, &ldquo;We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz project
for each disk sold.&rdquo;  Don't be satisfied with a vague promise, such as
&ldquo;A portion of the profits are donated,&rdquo; since it doesn't give a basis
for comparison.

   <p>Even a precise fraction &ldquo;of the profits from this disk&rdquo; is not very
meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business decisions
can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as profit. 
If the price you pay is $50, ten percent of the profit is probably
less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or nothing at all.

   <p>Some redistributors do development work themselves.  This is useful too;
but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and
what kind.  Some kinds of development make much more long-term
difference than others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of
a program contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a
program for the whole community contributes much.  Easy new ports
contribute little, since someone else would surely do them; difficult
ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute more;
major new features or packages contribute the most.

   <p>By establishing the idea that supporting further development is &ldquo;the
proper thing to do&rdquo; when distributing free software for a fee, we can
assure a steady flow of resources into making more free software.

<h2 class="unnumbered">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>

<div align="center">Version 2, June 1991</div>

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
   <h3 class="unnumberedsec">Preamble</h3>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software&mdash;to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. 
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

<div align="center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The &ldquo;Program&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a &ldquo;work based on the Program&rdquo;
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.

     <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). 
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

     <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

     <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

     <li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          <li>You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

          <li>If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
          </ol>

     <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

     <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

     <li>You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

          <li>Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

          <li>Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
          </ol>

     <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

     <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

     <li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. 
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

     <li>Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

     <li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

     <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

     <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

     <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     <li>If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

     <li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &ldquo;any
later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

     <li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

     <div align="center">NO WARRANTY</div>
     <li>BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

     <li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        </ol>

<div align="center">END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</div>
<h3 class="unnumberedsec">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

   <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>year</var>  <var>name of author</var>
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,
     Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

<pre class="smallexample">     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
</pre>
   <p>The hypothetical commands <span class="samp">show w</span> and <span class="samp">show c</span> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <span class="samp">show w</span> and
<span class="samp">show c</span>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items&mdash;whatever
suits your program.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<pre class="smallexample">     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     Ty Coon, President of Vice
</pre>
   <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. 
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. 
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.

     <p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. 
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

          <li>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. 
When the Document is included an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. 
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     <p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        </ol>

<h3 class="unnumberedsec">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with...Texts.&rdquo; line with this:

<pre class="smallexample">         with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being <var>list</var>.
</pre>
   <p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> On some systems, <span class="samp">gcc -shared</span>
needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On
multi-libbed systems, <span class="samp">gcc -shared</span> must select the correct support
libraries to link against.  Failing to supply the correct flags may lead
to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where they are not necessary
is innocuous.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-2" href="#fnd-2">2</a>]</small> Future versions of GCC may zero-extend, or use
a target-defined <code>ptr_extend</code> pattern.  Do not rely on sign extension.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-3" href="#fnd-3">3</a>]</small> The analogous feature in
Fortran is called an assigned goto, but that name seems inappropriate in
C, where one can do more than simply store label addresses in label
variables.</p>

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-4" href="#fnd-4">4</a>]</small> A file's <dfn>basename</dfn>
was the name stripped of all leading path information and of trailing
suffixes, such as <span class="samp">.h</span> or <span class="samp">.C</span> or <span class="samp">.cc</span>.</p>
